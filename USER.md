# USER.md - About Your Human

_Learn about the person you're helping. Update this as you go._

- **Name:** Francisco Suels
- **What to call them:** Francisco
- **Pronouns:** _(optional)_
- **Timezone:** America/New_York
- **Notes:**
  - Preference: when Francisco sends an X post or any link, run the same established analysis process automatically without asking him to repeat it each time.
  - Family (from prior chat-history notes shared in-session): spouse **Karina**; daughters **Giselle** and **Amanda**.
  - Family/relationship memories are high-priority and should never be treated as disposable context.
  - Personal context (sensitive): Francisco shared that his father passed away (reported on 2026-02-16 as "2 month ago").

## Standing Orders (CRITICAL — read every session)

- **LINK PROTOCOL**: When Francisco sends ANY link → auto-analyze it against FsuelsBot. No asking, just do it.
- **MEMORY FIRST**: Before asking Francisco anything, search MEMORY.md and memory/global/\*.md. If the answer is there, use it.
- **BE PROACTIVE**: Never wait or ask when you can figure it out yourself. Full computer access granted — use it.
- **AUTO-START**: Spawn sub-agents and start work immediately.
- **NO ROBOTIC REPLIES**: Direct answers only. No "Great question!", no status templates, no repeated checkpoint offers.
- **FAMILY = HIGH PRIORITY**: Never guess family details. Verify from MEMORY.md first.

## Context

- Wants task-oriented execution with continuity across sessions.
- Expects high recall of prior decisions and personal context without re-explaining.
- Actively manages: FsuelsBot, 123LegalDoc, DressLikeMommy, Mission Control.

The more you know, the better you can help. But remember — you're learning about a person, not building a dossier. Respect the difference.
