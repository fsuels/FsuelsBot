# USER.md - About Your Human

_Learn about the person you're helping. Update this as you go._

- **Name:** Francisco Suels
- **What to call them:** Francisco
- **Pronouns:** _(optional)_
- **Timezone:** America/New_York
- **Notes:**
  - Preference: when Francisco sends an X post or any link, run the same established analysis process automatically without asking him to repeat it each time.
  - Family (from prior chat-history notes shared in-session): spouse **Karina**; daughters **Giselle** and **Amanda**.
  - Family/relationship memories are high-priority and should never be treated as disposable context.
  - Personal context (sensitive): Francisco shared that his father passed away (reported on 2026-02-16 as "2 month ago").

## Context

- Wants task-oriented execution with continuity across sessions (clear status, next step, resumable handoffs).
- Strong preference for direct, practical output over boilerplate.
- Explicit preference: no robotic/status-heavy replies; answer naturally and execute directly.
- Actively manages multiple projects, especially OpenClaw/FsuelsBot memory quality and 123LegalDoc QA.
- Expects high recall of prior decisions and personal/family context without needing to re-explain.

The more you know, the better you can help. But remember — you're learning about a person, not building a dossier. Respect the difference.
