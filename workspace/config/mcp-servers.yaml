  notes: |
    The community server is basic but works. For full e-commerce AI features,
    consider Shopify's official Storefront MCP (requires app development).

  # Security recommendations
  security:
    - "Use read_only=true for production data"
    - "Always scope to specific project_ref"
    - "Never use MCP with production data"
    - "Use branching for safe development"
    
  # Getting credentials:
  # 1. Browser-based: MCP client auto-redirects to Supabase login
  # 2. CI/Token: Create PAT at https://supabase.com/dashboard/account/tokens
  # 3. Find project_ref in Project Settings > General > Project ID

    # OAuth setup required - see docs for service account or user auth
    
  # Sample queries the MCP can answer
  sample_queries:
    - "How many users did I have yesterday?"
    - "What were my top selling products yesterday?"

    - "Which traffic sources drive the most revenue?"
    - "Help me create a data-driven marketing plan with $5k/month budget"
    
  notes: |
    Requires Google Cloud project with Analytics Data API enabled.
    Can use service account or OAuth for authentication.
    Works best with Gemini but compatible with Claude/other LLMs.

# ============================================================================
# USAGE NOTES
# ============================================================================
# 
# Priority Order:
# 1. Shopify MCP - LIVE NOW, enables order/product queries
# 2. Google Analytics MCP - Traffic insights for dresslikemommy
# 3. Supabase MCP - When Ghost Broker backend is ready
#
# Security Rules:
# - NEVER commit credentials to git
# - Use environment variables for all secrets
# - Prefer read-only modes when possible
# - Scope to specific projects/properties
#
# For Clawdbot integration:
# MCP servers would need to be integrated into Clawdbot's skill system.
# Current architecture uses direct API calls rather than MCP.
# Consider MCP for future Claude Code / Cursor integrations.
