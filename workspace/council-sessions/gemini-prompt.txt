I'm designing a self-improving AI agent system for my AI assistant + e-commerce business (Shopify dropshipping mommy-and-me outfits, ~$15K/year revenue, targeting profitability). I want to synthesize 4 tech visionaries' thinking into one coherent architecture:

1. Elon Musk: Delete what shouldn't exist. His 5-step algorithm: (1) Make requirements less dumb, (2) Delete the part/process, (3) Simplify/optimize, (4) Accelerate cycle time, (5) Automate - in that order.

2. Andrej Karpathy: Verify fast, keep outputs small. The bottleneck is human verification. Keep AI outputs small enough to check quickly. Use GUIs for fast visual checks. Run agents locally with your real context.

3. Demis Hassabis (DeepMind) - 5 principles: Self-play/iterate fast (auto-score outputs, tight feedback loops), Smallest brain possible (script > small model > big model, escalate only when simpler fails), Inductive biases (domain-specific thinking per function), Curiosity-driven exploration, Hierarchical planning (big goal > sub-goals > tasks).

4. Ryan Carson: Compound Engineering nightly loop: Phase 1 (10:30 PM) agent reviews all work, extracts learnings, updates instruction files. Phase 2 (11:00 PM) agent pulls updated instructions, picks #1 priority task, implements autonomously. Wake up to shipped work every morning.

Current system: Claude Max ($100/mo flat, unlimited Opus+Sonnet), free Grok/ChatGPT/Gemini access, 4-layer memory system, heartbeat loops every 30 min, nightly consolidation at 3AM, auto-commit at 11PM, sub-agent spawning.

HOW should I combine ALL four philosophies into one coherent self-improving architecture? Specifically answer ALL 7:
1. What should the nightly autonomous loop look like? (safe auto-execute vs needs human review?)
2. How should outputs be auto-scored for self-play feedback loops?
3. How should tasks be prioritized? What scoring system?
4. What domain-specific agent personas should exist?
5. How should the curiosity engine work - what should it explore autonomously?
6. What is the goal hierarchy from business profitable down to daily tasks?
7. What should be DELETED from the current system (applying Musk algorithm)?

Be specific and actionable. Give concrete implementations, not abstract principles.
