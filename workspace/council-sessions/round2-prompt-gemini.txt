Two other AI experts proposed architectures for the same problem (personal AI assistant with perfect memory, guaranteed task completion, and continuous self-improvement). Here are their key proposals:

EXPERT A (Grok) proposed:
- Simple markdown/JSON file-based approach, no databases
- Priority system P0-P3 on all memory entries
- MEMORY.md as master + per-topic .md files in TOPICS/ directory
- Simple regex/grep text search for recall at session startup
- Single tasks.json file as source of truth
- 5-state task machine: NEW, IN_PROGRESS, BLOCKED, DONE, ARCHIVED
- 3-level escalation: reminder -> spawn sub-agent -> dead-man Telegram alert
- Simple performance.json with daily metrics
- A/B testing via even/odd day system prompt alternation
- Overnight reflection agent proposes exactly 3 improvements
- 4 simple Python scripts under 100 lines each
- Focus on simplicity and building TODAY

EXPERT B (ChatGPT) proposed:
- Event-sourced architecture with append-only JSONL ledgers as single source of truth
- SQLite FTS5 for indexing + materialized views rebuilt from ledgers
- Structured memory types: fact, decision, preference, commitment, relationship, asset, procedure
- "Recall Pack" concept injected into every planning step with trigger words
- 10-state task machine: CAPTURED, TRIAGED, PLANNED, READY, EXECUTING, WAITING_EXTERNAL, BLOCKED_INTERNAL, VERIFYING, DONE, CANCELLED
- Required "Definition of Done" with completion proofs for every task
- 5-level escalation (L0 silent to L4 dead-man switch blocking ALL new work)
- Experiments registry with A/B testing, guardrails, and automatic rollback
- Incident logging: MISSED_DEADLINE, WRONG_RECALL, BAD_EXTRACTION, EXECUTION_FAILURE
- Nightly offline eval replaying yesterday's transcripts
- Cron every 1-5 minutes for task reconciliation
- The most complex and thorough proposal

Don't just critique - BUILD A BETTER SOLUTION. What did they miss? What's wrong with their approaches? And most importantly: what's a SUPERIOR architecture that combines the best of everything and beats all proposals? Be specific with file structures, state machines, and cron schedules.
