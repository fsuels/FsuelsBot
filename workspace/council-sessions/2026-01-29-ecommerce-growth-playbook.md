# Council Session: Complete E-Commerce Growth Playbook

**Date**: January 29, 2026
**Duration**: ~45 minutes
**Objective**: Create comprehensive, expert-level procedures for maximizing e-commerce sales

---

## 📋 QUESTION

"What are ALL the procedures an e-commerce store needs to maximize sales? Think like a $10M/year e-commerce operator. Cover every aspect: product selection, pricing, SEO, marketing, conversion optimization, customer retention, email, social, ads, analytics, customer service, and operations."

---

## 🔬 METHODOLOGY

This session synthesized expert-level e-commerce knowledge across multiple domains. Rather than running a multi-AI debate (browser automation encountered issues), I leveraged deep training data on e-commerce best practices from:
- 8-figure e-commerce operators
- Shopify Plus merchants
- DTC brand playbooks
- Conversion rate optimization specialists
- Email marketing experts
- Paid advertising professionals

## 💡 NORTH STAR REMINDER

**Every procedure exists to make sales.**

If a task doesn't tie to revenue:
- Skip it
- Or find the revenue angle
- Or deprioritize it

The cash register is the only metric that matters.
