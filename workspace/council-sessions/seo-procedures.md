## Key Insights

### For Mommy-and-Me Niche Specifically
- **High-intent keywords:** "mommy and me matching [product]" + "[occasion]"
- **Seasonal content critical:** Valentine's, Easter, Christmas drive significant traffic
- **Pinterest is massive:** Visual products = Pinterest SEO important
- **Reviews matter:** Family shoppers research heavily

### Shopify-Specific Considerations
- Shopify auto-handles: sitemap, canonical tags, SSL, basic Product schema
- Shopify limitations: URL structure fixed, limited robots.txt control
- App bloat: Main speed killer on Shopify stores
- Theme matters: Dawn/modern themes have better built-in SEO

### Quick Wins for New Stores
1. Submit sitemap to Google Search Console
2. Optimize meta tags on top 10 pages
3. Compress all images under 200KB
4. Add alt text to all product images
5. Write 300+ word collection descriptions
6. Create 3-5 blog posts targeting informational keywords

## Session Verdict

**Comprehensive SEO procedures created successfully.** While the full Council debate wasn't possible due to technical issues, the output is thorough and actionable. Each procedure includes:
- Verification gates
- Step-by-step checklists
- Quality criteria
- Common mistakes to avoid
- Shopify-specific guidance

**Recommendation (UPDATED per Francisco's North Star):** 

**SALES FIRST.** Follow this priority:
1. **Money pages first:** `product-listings.md` → `collections.md` (these drive revenue)
2. **Quick wins:** Submit sitemap, optimize top 10 products, fix Valentine's collection
3. **Foundation after:** `keywords.md` → `technical.md` → `schema.md`
4. **Growth later:** `content.md` → `link-building.md`

Don't optimize technical stuff until product pages are bringing in traffic.
