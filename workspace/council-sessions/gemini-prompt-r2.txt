Round 1 CONSENSUS was B+ with these 5 agreements:

1. Architecture is solid — task lanes, audit trails, step-tracking
2. Atomicity is unclear — heartbeat saves may corrupt on crash
3. Multiple truth sources = drift risk — state vs ledger vs learnings vs pack
4. Security claims need specifics — "prompt injection defenses" too vague
5. Scalability will hit limits — JSONL files don't scale for queries

What would get A+:
1. Pick ONE canonical source → derive everything else
2. Atomic writes with transaction manifest
3. Hash-chained audit logs
4. Pack regeneration under evaluation/rollback
5. Explicit threat model

Now dig DEEPER. What else is wrong? What did Round 1 MISS? Push harder for A+. Don't restate Round 1 findings — find NEW issues nobody caught yet.

CONTEXT: This is an AI agent memory system with: state.json (authoritative state), tasks.json (task board), events.jsonl (audit log), ledger.jsonl (structured events), learnings.db (SQLite), pack.md (curated context), active-thread.md (conversation continuity), knowledge/ wiki structure, Mission Control dashboard, heartbeat checkpoints, nightly consolidation loops.
