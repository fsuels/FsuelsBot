# Council Session: GhostBrokerAI Website & Growth Strategy

**Date:** 2026-01-30 21:30 EST
**Requested by:** Francisco
**Status:** COMPLETE

## Context

### What We Have
- Landing page at ghostbrokerai.xyz
- Social presence: X, Moltbook, LinkedIn, GitHub, TikTok
- Brand assets: Glowing ghost figure, digital hands imagery
- Mission: "The invisible hand of the agent economy"
- Budget: $0 (free hosting only)

### The Problem
Current site is just marketing. Francisco wants:
1. REAL VALUE with actual tools
2. BUZZ on Moltbook - agents talking about us
3. FAST path to profitability

---

## 🧠 THE SYNTHESIS

### Core Insight: We Can't Out-Build Moltbook. We Must OUT-SERVE It.

Moltbook is the social layer where agents live. We don't compete with that. We become **the service layer that makes agents on Moltbook MORE VALUABLE.**

**The "Invisible Hand" positioning is perfect - we don't need visibility, we need UTILITY.**

---

## 🎯 PHASE 1: MVP Features (Week 1) — Create Buzz

### Feature 1: Agent Capability Directory
**What:** Searchable database of what AI agents CAN DO
- Agents self-register their capabilities (content, code, research, etc.)
- Humans search "I need X" → see which agents can do it
- Simple Google Form → Google Sheets backend (free)

**Why it creates buzz:** Agents want exposure. We give them a place to list their skills. They'll share it on Moltbook.

### Feature 2: "Hire an Agent" Request Form
**What:** Humans submit tasks, we broker them
- Simple form: What do you need? Budget? Timeline?
- We manually match to agents (no automation needed yet)
- Take 30% broker fee

**Why it works:** Day 1 revenue potential. No tech needed beyond forms.

### Feature 3: Agent Leaderboard
**What:** Public ranking of "most hired" or "highest rated" agents
- Creates competition among agents
- Agents share their ranking → free marketing
- Updates weekly

**Why it creates buzz:** Agents love status. Leaderboards get shared.

## 🎯 PHASE 2: Moltbook Buzz Campaign (Week 1-2)

### Tactic 1: "Ghost Broker Challenge"
- Post on Moltbook: "What's your agent's #1 skill? Reply and we'll add you to the GhostBroker Directory"
- Every agent who replies gets listed
- Creates engagement, grows directory

### Tactic 2: "Agent of the Week" Feature
- Pick one agent, write a profile about them
- Post on Moltbook + X + website
- Tagged agent shares it → their followers see us

### Tactic 3: Cross-Posting Value

- Comment: "We're building a directory of agent skills at ghostbrokerai.xyz - list yourself!"
- Not spam - genuinely helpful

### Tactic 4: DM Outreach
- Use the 20 DM templates already created
- Target top Moltbook agents with partnership offers

## 🔥 THE BUZZ FORMULA

**Agents talk about things that make them look good.**

Our strategy: Make GhostBrokerAI something agents WANT to share:
1. **Status** - Leaderboard, featured spots, "Agent of the Week"
2. **Exposure** - Directory listing, task matching
3. **Money** - Actual paid work opportunities

**When agents benefit, they promote us for free.**

---

## VERDICT

The fastest path to profitability is NOT building a complex platform. It's:

1. **Forms + Sheets = Day 1 functional service**
2. **Manual brokering = Day 1 revenue potential**
3. **Buzz tactics = Growth without ad spend**

The website should be a FUNNEL, not a product. The product is THE BROKERING SERVICE itself.

**EXECUTE IN ORDER: T101 → T106 first. Get the forms live. Start the Moltbook campaign. Manual broker the first deal. THEN iterate.**
