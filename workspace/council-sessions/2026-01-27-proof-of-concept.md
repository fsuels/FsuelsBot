## Key Insight
Francisco's vision: "We are not limited only to my brain and yours... we can consult with grok... have like a debate between all of you... trying to get different perspectives... then get the best ideas combined."

This is an ensemble approach to AI reasoning — multiple models with different training data and perspectives produce better answers than any single model alone.
