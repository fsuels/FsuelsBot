I run a personal AI agent system (Claude-based, called Clawdbot) that manages my e-commerce business (Dress Like Mommy - mommy-and-me matching outfits, Shopify dropship, ~$15K/yr revenue). The system has: an Orchestrator (Opus), a QA Pressure Loop (Sonnet), a Research Loop (Gemini), and on-demand functions (Content, Automation, Council, PromptWork). We just built 8 procedure files, restructured from 8 idle specialists to 3+4 architecture, and built a dashboard with audit panels.

I want to apply three tech visionaries ideas to this system:

ELON MUSK 5-Step Algorithm: 1) Question every requirement 2) Delete ruthlessly (if you dont add back 10% you didnt delete enough) 3) Simplify/optimize only AFTER deleting 4) Accelerate cycle time 5) Automate last not first. Key: most people optimize things that shouldnt exist.

ANDREJ KARPATHY Practical AI Workflow: 1) Vibe coding crossed a threshold 2) Bottleneck is HUMAN VERIFICATION - keep outputs small use killer GUIs for fast checks 3) Run agents locally with your real context 4) Slopacolypse coming in 2026 - tons of low-quality AI junk 5) Fix: constrain the AI make verification loops lightning-fast 6) Depth over breadth - build projects hit walls learn on the fly

ILYA SUTSKEVER Age of Research: 1) Pure scaling hits limits 2) Breakthroughs needed in generalization better value functions continual learning 3) Self-play brain-inspired designs 4) AI that actually understands not just pattern-matches 5) Safety first big research bets

Answer ALL FIVE questions with detailed positions:

Q1: Should any of these ideas become PERMANENT P0 principles in our system? Draft the actual principle text.

Q2: Apply all three lenses to what we built TODAY (8 procedures, 3+4 team, dashboard). Elon: what should be DELETED? Karpathy: is verification fast enough? outputs small enough? Sutskever: is our system actually learning/generalizing or just pattern-matching tasks?

Q3: Whats the 10-second rule? Every output should be verifiable by the human operator in under 10 seconds. How do we enforce this? Does this change how dashboard artifacts and reports work?

Q4: What does slopacolypse mean for a small e-commerce brand? If AI junk floods the market how does quality plus trust become the differentiator for a mommy-and-me matching outfits store?

Q5: What should our QA Pressure Loop check include from these ideas? Should it ask Elons should this even exist? Should it check can the human verify this in 10 seconds?

Give thorough detailed positions on each question. This is for a multi-AI debate - your positions will be challenged by other AIs.
