Two other AI experts proposed architectures for the same problem (personal AI assistant with perfect memory, guaranteed task completion, and continuous self-improvement). Here are their key proposals:

EXPERT A (Grok) proposed:
- Simple markdown/JSON file-based approach, no SQLite or databases
- Priority system P0-P3 on all memory entries
- MEMORY.md as master + per-topic .md files in TOPICS/ directory
- Simple regex/grep text search for recall at session startup (top 5-8 matches + all P0 items)
- Single tasks.json file as source of truth
- 5-state task machine: NEW, IN_PROGRESS, BLOCKED, DONE, ARCHIVED
- 3-level escalation: reminder -> spawn sub-agent to advance task -> dead-man Telegram alert
- Simple performance.json with daily metrics array
- A/B testing via even/odd day system prompt alternation
- Overnight "reflection agent" proposes exactly 3 improvements and rewrites system_prompt.md
- 4 simple Python scripts, each under 100 lines, no external dependencies
- Focus on simplicity and implementability TODAY

EXPERT B (Gemini) proposed:
- "Cortex" orchestrator: lightweight Python script runs every minute, checks file state, only wakes Claude when needed (saves resources)
- "Second Brain" knowledge base with categorized directories: entities/, procedures/, principles/, insights/
- Dual logging: raw markdown + structured JSONL simultaneously
- Individual task files (one JSON per task in a directory, not one big file)
- 5-state machine: PENDING, ACTIVE, BLOCKED, COMPLETED, FAILED
- Dead-man switch: failed tasks auto-create high-priority RCA tasks
- "Patch" system for improvements: proposed patches -> council critique -> validated -> applied
- Council as "Critics" reviewing proposed system improvements before deployment
- Virtuous cycle: Task failures -> patches -> updated procedures -> better recall
- Memory consolidation prompts Claude for typed outputs: new_entities, updated_entities, new_procedures, new_principles, new_insights

Don't just critique - BUILD A BETTER SOLUTION. What did they miss? What's wrong with their approaches? And most importantly: what's a SUPERIOR architecture that combines the best of everything and beats all proposals? Be specific with file structures, state machines, and cron schedules.
