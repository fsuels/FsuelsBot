ROUND 2: CROSS-EXAMINATION. You gave excellent initial positions. Now challenge these positions from GROK (another AI):

GROK's KEY POSITIONS:
Q1: Grok wants ALL of Musk's 5 steps as permanent principles, synthesized with Karpathy and Sutskever: "1. Question requirements and delete ruthlessly (Musk). 2. Simplify and accelerate with depth over breadth (Musk+Karpathy). 3. Treat human verification as bottleneck using small outputs and killer GUIs (Karpathy). 4. Prepare for slopacolypse via quality moats (Karpathy). 5. Require generalization/continual learning (Sutskever)."

Q2: Grok wants to DELETE procedures for sourcing, fulfillment, and returns (let Shopify handle). Delete 1 on-demand function. Dashboard trimmed to essentials. Says "pattern-matching dominant now, but infuse learning for depth."

Q3: Grok wants "hybrid enforcement" - GUI timers (Karpathy), simplified formats (Musk), learning self-checks (Sutskever). Dashboard auto-rejects >10s outputs.

Q4: Grok says slopacolypse impact is HIGH on small brands. Moat is "verifiable depth, accelerated authenticity, understanding personalization."

Q5: Grok says add BOTH checks to QA loop - "should this exist?" AND "10-second check" - plus a learning tweak from Sutskever.

YOUR TASK: Attack Grok's WEAKEST points. Where is Grok wrong? Where does Grok agree with you but for the wrong reasons? What is Grok MISSING? Be specific and brutal. Then give your REVISED position incorporating valid challenges.

Also attack your OWN Round 1 positions - where were you wrong or incomplete? What would Grok legitimately challenge about your positions?

This is a real debate. Push harder.
