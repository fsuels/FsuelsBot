I'm building a personal AI assistant (runs on Claude Opus 4.5, local machine, Telegram interface) that manages a soloentrepreneur's entire business. The system needs to solve THREE problems that no AI assistant has fully solved yet:

1. PERFECT MEMORY - The AI wakes up fresh each session with no memory. How do you architect a memory system that ensures NOTHING important is ever forgotten? Consider: daily logs vs structured databases, semantic search, memory consolidation (like human sleep), priority levels, automatic pruning, cross-referencing, and proactive recall.

2. GUARANTEED TASK COMPLETION - Tasks get created but fall through cracks. How do you guarantee every task reaches completion? Consider: task state machines, escalation protocols, deadline tracking, dependency chains, automated follow-ups, accountability reports, and dead-man switches.

3. CONTINUOUS SELF-IMPROVEMENT - The system should get measurably better every day without human intervention. How? Consider: error tracking, A/B testing approaches, performance metrics, overnight build jobs, skill acquisition, and compound learning loops.

The system already has: memory files (daily .md logs plus MEMORY.md long-term), a Mission Control dashboard (Kanban plus team view), cron jobs, sub-agent spawning, and multi-AI council (Grok, ChatGPT, Gemini, Open Arena). Budget is ZERO extra - only existing subscriptions.

Give me a detailed, implementable architecture for all three systems. Be specific about file structures, state machines, cron schedules, and data flows. No hand-waving - I want blueprints I can build today.
