Two other AI experts proposed architectures for the same problem (personal AI assistant with perfect memory, guaranteed task completion, and continuous self-improvement). Here are their key proposals:

EXPERT A (ChatGPT) proposed:
- Event-sourced architecture with append-only JSONL ledgers as single source of truth for memory AND tasks
- SQLite FTS5 for indexing, materialized views rebuilt from ledgers
- Structured memory types: fact, decision, preference, commitment, relationship, asset, procedure, context, reflection
- "Recall Pack" injected into every planning step, with specific trigger words (decide, send, pay, publish)
- 10-state task machine: CAPTURED, TRIAGED, PLANNED, READY, EXECUTING, WAITING_EXTERNAL, BLOCKED_INTERNAL, VERIFYING, DONE, CANCELLED
- Required "Definition of Done" with completion proofs for every task
- 5-level escalation (L0 silent dashboard to L4 dead-man switch that blocks ALL new work)
- Experiments registry with A/B testing, guardrails, and automatic rollback
- Incident logging with typed failures (MISSED_DEADLINE, WRONG_RECALL, BAD_EXTRACTION, etc.)
- Nightly offline eval that replays yesterday's transcripts to test improvements
- Cron every 1-5 minutes for reconciliation

EXPERT B (Gemini) proposed:
- "Cortex" orchestrator: a lightweight Python script that runs every minute, checks file state, and only wakes Claude when needed
- "Second Brain" knowledge base with categorized directories: entities/, procedures/, principles/, insights/
- Dual logging: raw markdown + structured JSONL simultaneously
- Individual task files (one JSON per task, not one big file)
- "Patch" system for improvements: proposed patches -> council critique -> validated -> applied
- Council of Critics: other AIs review proposed improvements before applying
- Virtuous cycle: Task failures -> patches -> updated procedures -> better recall next time
- Memory consolidation produces typed outputs: new_entities, updated_entities, new_procedures, new_principles, new_insights

Don't just critique - BUILD A BETTER SOLUTION. What did they miss? What's wrong with their approaches? And most importantly: what's a SUPERIOR architecture that combines the best of everything and beats all proposals? Be specific with file structures, state machines, and cron schedules.
