Adversarial synthesis exploits disagreement, doesn't smooth it.","lesson":"Attack the synthesis method, not the council concept"}
{"ts":"2026-01-30T00:50:00Z","session":"council-skill-self-eval","failed_claim":"LLMs are pattern-matching, not real debate","broken_by":"ChatGPT","reason":"Discovery doesn't require 'true understanding'. It requires structured error surface exploration. Multiple LLMs with orthogonal training produce non-overlapping failure modes.","lesson":"The goal is exposing contradictions, not simulating human debate"}

Solution: optimize for divergence first, convergence last. Treat consensus as terminal phase.","lesson":"Penalize early convergence, reward incompatibility"}
