- **Wholesale queries** are a notable traffic category — the wholesale/dropship page drives real interest
- **Seasonal patterns**: swimwear queries prominent in summer, Christmas pajamas in winter

## 2. Indexing

**Last Updated:** January 23, 2026

| Status | Count |
|--------|-------|
| ✅ Indexed | 304 |
| ❌ Not Indexed | 4,885 |
| **Total Known Pages** | **5,189** |

### Why Pages Aren't Indexed (10 reasons):

| Reason | Source | Pages |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Excluded by 'noindex' tag | Website | 1,611 |
| Alternate page with proper canonical tag | Website | 1,405 |
| Page with redirect | Website | 740 |
| Not found (404) | Website | 591 |
| Crawled — currently not indexed | Google systems | 452 |
| Discovered — currently not indexed | Google systems | 67 |
| Server error (5xx) | Website | 11 |
| Blocked by robots.txt | Website | 4 |
| Blocked due to access forbidden (403) | Website | 2 |
| Duplicate, Google chose different canonical | Google systems | 2 |

**Indexing Analysis:**
- ⚠️ **Only 5.9% of known pages are indexed** (304 out of 5,189) — but this is largely expected for a Shopify store
- **1,611 noindex pages** — likely Shopify system pages (tags, collections pages with filters, etc.) — normal
- **1,405 canonical alternates** — Shopify creates variant URLs that point to canonical versions — normal
- **740 redirects** — possibly old product URLs that redirect to new ones
- ⚠️ **591 404 errors** — significant; these are broken links/deleted pages Google still tries to crawl
- ⚠️ **452 crawled but not indexed** — Google crawled these but chose not to index them (thin content, duplicate content, or low value)
- ⚠️ **67 discovered but not indexed** — Google knows about these pages but hasn't bothered to crawl them yet
- **11 server errors (5xx)** — minor, but worth monitoring

## 3. Sitemaps

**4 sitemaps submitted** — all returning **Success** status:

| Sitemap URL | Submitted | Last Read | Pages Found |
|-------------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| https://www.dresslikemommy.com/sitemap.xml | Dec 29, 2025 | Jan 22, 2026 | 407 |
| http://www.dresslikemommy.com/sitemap.xml | Feb 14, 2017 | Jan 24, 2026 | 409 |
| https://dresslikemommy.com/sitemap.xml | Feb 14, 2017 | Jan 22, 2026 | 407 |
| http://dresslikemommy.com/sitemap.xml | Feb 14, 2017 | Jan 20, 2026 | 407 |

**Sitemap Notes:**
- All 4 variants (http/https, www/non-www) are submitted — the HTTPS www version was resubmitted Dec 29, 2025
- All are "Sitemap index" type (likely containing sub-sitemaps for products, collections, pages, blogs)
- ~407-409 pages discovered per sitemap — consistent
- Google reads them regularly (every few days)
- ℹ️ Having 4 sitemaps for all URL variants is redundant but harmless since all variants redirect to the canonical version

## 4. Core Web Vitals

**Last Updated:** January 24, 2026  
**Source:** Chrome UX Report (real user data)

| Device | Good | Needs Improvement | Poor |
|--------|------|-------------------|------|

**Status:** ⚠️ **No data available**
- Mobile: Shows 0 across all categories — likely insufficient real-user data in CrUX
- Desktop: "Not enough usage data in the last 90 days" — explicitly confirmed
- **This means the site doesn't get enough Chrome traffic to generate CrUX data**, not that the pages are fast or slow
- Recommendation: Test with [PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/report?url=dresslikemommy.com) for lab-based performance data

**HTTPS Status:**
- 109 HTTPS URLs served
- 0 Non-HTTPS URLs — ✅ All secure

## 🎯 Key Takeaways & Recommendations

### Strengths
1. ✅ No manual actions or security issues
2. ✅ All sitemaps successfully processed
3. ✅ 100% HTTPS
4. ✅ Product structured data clean (75 valid, 0 invalid)
5. ✅ Solid internal linking structure
6. ✅ Wholesale page driving real B2B traffic organically

### Critical Issues
1. 🔴 **Extremely low organic traffic** — 360 clicks in 3 months (~4/day)
2. 🔴 **Only 35 external backlinks** — virtually no domain authority
3. 🔴 **591 pages returning 404** — dead pages Google keeps trying to crawl
4. 🔴 **452 pages crawled but not indexed** — Google sees them as low quality
5. 🔴 **Very low CTR** (0.5-0.7%) — titles and meta descriptions aren't compelling

### Opportunities
1. 📈 **"family matching outfits"** gets 16,577 impressions but only 56 clicks — huge CTR optimization opportunity
2. 📈 **"matching family outfits"** — 7,166 impressions, 34 clicks — same story
3. 📈 **"mommy and me dresses"** — 4,553 impressions, 30 clicks
4. 📈 **Wholesale/B2B page** is the #1 clicked page — consider creating more wholesale content
5. 📈 **UK market** shows strong interest — could optimize for UK-specific terms
6. 📈 **Desktop CTR** is half of mobile — desktop experience or SERP snippet needs attention

### Action Items
1. **Fix 404s** — Redirect or restore the 591 pages returning 404 errors
2. **Build backlinks** — 35 external links is critically low for any e-commerce site
3. **Optimize meta titles & descriptions** for high-impression pages to improve CTR
4. **Add review structured data** — currently 0 review snippets despite being a product store
5. **Fix unparsable structured data** (1 item)
6. **Create blog/content** around top-performing queries to capture more organic traffic
7. **Monitor the 452 "crawled but not indexed" pages** — improve content quality or consolidate thin pages
8. **Run PageSpeed Insights** manually since CrUX doesn't have enough data
