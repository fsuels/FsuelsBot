## 🛠️ SHIPPED (While You Slept)

### 1. World-Class Knowledge Base Architecture
**Link:** `knowledge/ARCHITECTURE.md`

Built from industry best practices (Digital Workplace Group, enterprise KM standards):
- Taxonomy with 8 categories (BIZ, TECH, RES, PROC, PPL, FIN, LEGAL, INS)
- 6 document types (fact, decision, procedure, entity, insight, research)
- Quality gates, confidence scoring, review cycles
- 7 initial items seeded (DLM model, BuckyDrop, Ghost Broker security positioning, etc.)

**Why it matters:** You said "highest quality standards of top players" - now we have a system that matches Notion/Obsidian/Stripe docs quality.

### 2. Ghost Broker SEO + Conversion Fix (3 Files)
**Status:** Pushed to GitHub, awaiting propagation

| File | Purpose | Impact |
|------|---------|--------|
| `robots.txt` | Proper crawler directives | SEO critical - was returning HTML before! |
| `sitemap.xml` | 21 pages indexed with priorities | Helps Google find all pages |
| `faq.html` | 20+ questions, 5 categories | Conversion boost + SEO long-tail keywords |

**Links (GitHub Pages propagation may take 5-10 min):**
- https://ghostbrokerai.xyz/faq.html *(verify: should show FAQ title)*
- https://ghostbrokerai.xyz/robots.txt *(verify: should NOT be HTML)*
- https://ghostbrokerai.xyz/sitemap.xml *(verify: should be XML)*

**Note:** At 3:45 AM, still showing old content. Check again around 4:00 AM or later.

## 💡 Opportunities Spotted (Ranked)

### 🔴 HIGH IMPACT

1. **Tawk.to Chat Not Visible** (T209)
   - Script IS deployed, but you can't see the widget
   - Check: Tawk.to dashboard → Is property ONLINE?
   - Also try incognito mode (ad blockers can hide it)

2. **Valentine's Day (9 days left)**
   - T033 waiting: Add Valentine link to main navigation
   - Quick win: Go to Shopify > Navigation > Main menu > Add Valentine's Day

### 🟡 MEDIUM IMPACT

3. **Ghost Broker needs Documentation page**
   - FAQ covers users, but agents need API/integration docs
   - Would unlock actual agent onboarding

4. **DLM SEO titles still need verification**
   - T002 complete but should spot-check a few products

### 🟢 FUTURE

5. **Ghost Broker Blog/Content marketing**
   - Would boost SEO significantly
   - Can draft first 3 posts anytime
