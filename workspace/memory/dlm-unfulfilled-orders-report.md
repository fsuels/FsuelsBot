## 🔴 PRIORITY 2: OVERDUE — HIGH CHARGEBACK RISK

### Order #9428 — Kathy Jurecek — $402.84 — ADDRESS ISSUES ⚠️
| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Order #** | #9428 |
| **Date** | December 27, 2025 (31 days ago) |
| **Total** | **$402.84** (largest unfulfilled order!) |
| **Items** | 16 — Family Matching Holiday Safari Animal Pajamas (multiple sizes: baby, child, father, mother) |
| **Payment** | Paid via Shop Pay (Visa ending 4720) — Payout received $388.44 |
| **Fulfillment** | ❌ Unfulfilled — China Warehouse |
| **Customer** | Kathy Jurecek (koj41611@aol.com) — 1st order |
| **Shipping** | Kate Jurecek, 4310 Pecan Bayou, Corpus Christi TX 78410, United States (+1 361-537-3980) |
| **Flags** | 🚩 **ADDRESS ISSUES** (Shopify flagged) — "Kate" vs "Kathy" name mismatch |
| **Shopify Protect** | Was eligible but **EXPIRED January 3** — NO longer protected |
| **Risk** | 🔴 Extremely high. $402 order, 1 month old, no protection. Christmas pajamas — seasonal urgency passed. |
| **Action** | 🔴 **DECISION NEEDED:** Either (a) fulfill immediately despite address issue, or (b) contact customer to confirm address, or (c) consider partial refund/cancellation. The Shopify Protect deadline has passed, so if she chargebacks, you lose $402. Contact her FIRST. |

### Order #9392 — Sally Cloud — $154.92 — 7 MONTHS OLD 🔴
| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Order #** | #9392 |
| **Date** | June 22, 2025 (**7 months ago!**) |
| **Total** | $154.92 |
| **Items** | 8 — Various matching mother-daughter swimsuits/tankinis |
| **Payment** | Paid via Apple Pay (Visa ending 6231) — Payout received $150.13 |
| **Fulfillment** | ❌ Unfulfilled — China Warehouse |
| **Customer** | Sally Cloud (princesspharaoh@gmail.com) — 1st order |
| **Shipping** | Ariel Cloud, 2033 Santuomo Ave, Grove City OH 43123, United States (+1 614-875-8699) |
| **Notes** | None |
| **Risk** | 🔴 EXTREME chargeback risk. 7 months is insane. Customer has probably given up or filed a dispute already. |
| **Action** | 🔴 **Email customer immediately.** Apologize profusely. Offer full refund OR immediate fulfillment, her choice. Summer swimsuits in January may not be wanted anymore. Proactive refund may be better than waiting for chargeback + fees. |

### Order #9383 — Lidson Charite — $55.97 — 9 MONTHS OLD 🔴
| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Order #** | #9383 |
| **Date** | April 27, 2025 (**9 months ago!**) |
| **Total** | $55.97 ($42.98 subtotal + $12.99 Premium Shipping) |
| **Items** | 2 — Mommy and Me Matching Floral Print Jumpsuits (Baby 3-6M + Mother XL) |
| **Payment** | Paid via Shop Pay Installments — Payout received $52.37 |
| **Fulfillment** | ❌ Unfulfilled — China Warehouse |
| **Customer** | Lidson Charite (lidson.charite@gmail.com) — 1st order |
| **Shipping** | 10571 NW 8th St, Pembroke Pines FL 33026, United States (+1 786-301-7887) |
| **Notes** | None |
| **Risk** | 🔴 EXTREME. 9 months! Baby ordered at 3-6 months is now over a year old — the item is useless. Paid PREMIUM shipping too. |
| **Action** | 🔴 **Proactively refund.** This is indefensible. A baby that was 3-6 months is now 12-15 months. The item doesn't fit anymore. Email customer with apology and process full refund immediately. |

## 🟡 PRIORITY 3: PARTIALLY FULFILLED — ITEMS MISSING

### Order #9409 — Unnati Shah — $245.87 — CHARGEBACK LOST 💀
| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Order #** | #9409 |
| **Date** | October 24, 2025 |
| **Total** | $245.87 |
| **Items** | 13 total — 6 fulfilled by BuckyDrop (Nov 22), **7 still unfulfilled** |
| **Payment** | Paid via Visa ending 9454 — **CHARGEBACK LOST $260.87** (Dec 12) |
| **Fulfillment** | ⚠️ Partially fulfilled — 7 items remain (Family Matching Fun Beach Set) |
| **Customer** | Unnati Shah (unnatishah3@gmail.com) — 1st order |
| **Shipping** | Tejas Shah (different name), 1545 NW 57th St unit 424, Seattle WA 98107 |
| **Billing** | Unnati Shah, 2870 Wagon Wheel Road Unit 201, Oxnard CA 93036 (DIFFERENT) |
| **Source** | chatgpt.com (interesting!) |
| **Notes** | None |
| **Risk** | 💀 **Money already lost.** $260.87 deducted from payouts. Bank ruled in customer's favor Dec 12. |
| **Action** | ⚫ **No fulfillment action needed.** Money is gone. Do NOT fulfill remaining items. Archive/close this order. Learn from it — partial fulfillment + different shipping/billing addresses = chargeback risk. |

### Order #9388 — Amanda Keesee — $68.96 — 1 Item Left Behind
| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Order #** | #9388 |
| **Date** | June 2, 2025 (8 months ago) |
| **Total** | $68.96 |
| **Items** | 4 total — 3 fulfilled by BuckyDrop (Jun 13), **1 still unfulfilled** |
| **Unfulfilled item** | Daddy & Baby Matching "Daddysaurus"/"Babysaurus" T-Shirt Set (Child 1 year / Black) — $15.99 |
| **Payment** | Paid via Apple Pay (Visa ending 8557) — Payout received $66.66 |
| **Customer** | Amanda Keesee (amandalkeesee@gmail.com) — 1st order |
| **Shipping** | 1260 Wellington Ter, Maitland FL 32751, United States (+1 407-758-5437) |
| **Notes** | None |
| **Risk** | 🟡 1 item worth $15.99 unfulfilled for 8 months. Low dollar amount but bad customer experience. |
| **Action** | 🟡 Email customer. Apologize for the missing item. Offer to ship it now OR refund the $15.99. The baby is now ~2 years old — a "1 year" size won't fit. Partial refund of $15.99 is probably the right call. |

---

## ✅ PRIORITY 4: REFUNDED — NO ACTION NEEDED (Close these)

| Order | Customer | Date | Amount | Status |
|-------|----------|------|--------|--------|
| #9416 | Mary MacDonald | Nov 24, 2025 | $0.00 | Refunded, 0 items — just close |

| #9400 | Samit Katuwal | Sep 25, 2025 | $0.00 | Refunded, 0 items — just close |

**Action:** Archive/close all 4 orders. They're just cluttering the unfulfilled view.

## ⚠️ CHARGEBACK WATCHLIST (Fulfilled orders with disputes)

| Order | Customer | Amount | Chargeback Status | Notes |
|-------|----------|--------|-------------------|-------|
| #9419 | Serena Friggel | $65.97 | **LOST** | Dec 1 order, fulfilled. Money gone. |

## 📋 FRANCISCO'S ACTION CHECKLIST

### TODAY (Jan 27) — Do These FIRST:

1. ☐ **#9432 (Diane Mcgahan, $64.98)** — Push to BuckyDrop NOW. Shopify Protect expires tomorrow Jan 28. Get tracking number uploaded today.

2. ☐ **#9431 (Petra Kostelná, $32.51)** — Push to BuckyDrop. Verify Czechia shipping. Only 10 days old, still reasonable.

3. ☐ **#9428 (Kathy Jurecek, $402.84)** — EMAIL customer first about address issue ("Kate" vs "Kathy"). Confirm she still wants the Christmas pajamas. If confirmed, push to BuckyDrop. If no response in 48h, consider refunding. Shopify Protect already expired — you're exposed.

### THIS WEEK — Customer Outreach:

4. ☐ **#9383 (Lidson Charite, $55.97)** — Process FULL REFUND. 9 months old. Baby outgrew the clothes. Email apology. Include a discount code for goodwill.

5. ☐ **#9392 (Sally Cloud, $154.92)** — EMAIL customer: apologize, offer full refund OR immediate shipment. Summer swimsuits in January — she probably wants the refund. If no response in 5 days, refund proactively.

6. ☐ **#9388 (Amanda Keesee, $15.99 remaining)** — Process PARTIAL REFUND of $15.99 for the 1 unfulfilled item. Email explaining the item was out of stock. Child is now too old for "1 year" size.

7. ☐ **#9409 (Unnati Shah, $245.87)** — No action. Chargeback already lost. Archive the order.

### HOUSEKEEPING — Clean up the queue:

8. ☐ Archive/close orders #9416, #9403, #9401, #9400 (all refunded, $0 value)

9. ☐ **Block Muhammed Yazici** — 4+ orders, multiple refunds and chargebacks. Fraudulent pattern.

10. ☐ **Investigate why orders aren't auto-fulfilling via BuckyDrop** — Check if there's a manual step needed, or if certain products aren't linked to BuckyDrop suppliers.

### PROCESS IMPROVEMENTS:

11. ☐ Set up alerts for unfulfilled orders older than 7 days
12. ☐ Review all orders weekly for fulfillment status  
13. ☐ Track Shopify Protect deadlines — never let them expire
14. ☐ Consider auto-fulfillment via BuckyDrop for all eligible orders
