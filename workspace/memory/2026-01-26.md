- Microsoft UET: 36005151 ✅
- Shopify Analytics: Built-in ✅
- Shopify Web Pixels: Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Pinterest, TikTok, Judge.me — ALL connected

## Critical Issues Found
1. Google Merchant Center: MISREPRESENTATION flag — all products blocked from Free Listings (US & UK)
2. Google Merchant Center: Invalid rectangular & square logos
3. Google Ads: Timezone set to Pacific (should be Eastern)
4. Google Ads: ALL 16 conversion actions dead (no recent conversions / needs attention)
5. Google Ads: Needs advertiser verification
6. Facebook Page: Missing phone, address, hours, price range, social links, reviews OFF
7. Facebook Page: 11 unread Messenger chats
8. Microsoft Ads: 1 inactive tag, 3 no recent conversion goals
9. 404 Not Found is #1 viewed page in GA (119 views last 7 days)
10. 215 users from China (likely bot traffic)
11. Two different Google accounts: Shopify = suelsferro@hotmail.com, Google Ads/Merchant = testhqfinds@gmail.com
12. Shopify business name in lowercase

## Phone Numbers
- Shopify: 7862875660
- Google Merchant Center: +17863096006 (Google Voice)
- Facebook Page: NOT SET
- Business email: info@dresslikemommy.com

## Fixes Completed
- **Shopify store name**: Changed from "dresslikemommy.com" → "Dress Like Mommy"
- **Facebook Page**: Added phone (+1 786-309-6006), address (Naples FL 34119), hours (always open), price range ($$)

## Critical Findings (Round 2)
- **Peggy Spino**: Ordered Dec 10 2024, never received nightgowns, 3 unanswered messages — chargeback risk
- **404 pages**: 21% of all page views (562 views, 545 broken URLs) — mostly old product/collection paths and locale-prefixed URLs
- **Chinese bot traffic**: 1,134 users (55% of ALL traffic), not 215 — zero engagement, $0 revenue
- **Google Ads tag**: Not properly installed — all 16 conversion actions dead
- **Merchant Center logos**: Both rejected — text not readable at small sizes
- **Facebook/Instagram**: Dozens of unread messages and comments beyond Peggy

## Fixes Completed (Round 3)
- **Bot traffic**: Deactivated International market (131 regions incl. China) and Eurozone market (43 regions). Only US market remains active.
- **404 redirects**: Top 4 priority redirects already existed. 50+ redirects already in place. Shopify supports CSV bulk import for remaining ~500 URLs.
- **Dedicated markets created**: UK (GBP), Canada (CAD), Australia (AUD) — all active with Dynamic FX. Taxes show "Not collecting" for all three — may need configuring if VAT/GST obligations exist.
- **Google Ads investigation complete**: Root cause is dual-system conflict + Merchant Center suspension. Report saved to memory/dlm-gads-report.md.

## Fixes Pending (Need Francisco)
- **Google Ads timezone**: Stuck on Pacific — Google doesn't allow changes. Would need a brand new account. Probably not worth it.
- **404 pages**: Need to check GA4 "Pages and screens" filtered by 404 title to find which URLs are broken, then set up redirects
- **Merchant Center misrepresentation**: Review requested Jan 26. Needs proper logos (rect 2:1 1000x500–2000x1000, square 1:1 500x500–2000x2000) and trust signals (reviews, badges, visible policies). All 7,800 products blocked until resolved.
- **Merchant Center logos**: Invalid rectangular and square logos need to be uploaded (SVG/PNG/WebP, ≤5MB)
- **Google Ads conversions**: Root cause = dual-system conflict (6 legacy + 7 Shopify Google app actions). Legacy snippets removed during migration, Shopify ones set to Secondary. Fix: retire legacy, promote Shopify actions to Primary. Merchant Center suspension is #1 blocker.
- **Google Ads verification**: Advertiser verification needed
- **Facebook Messenger**: 11 unread chats
- **Microsoft Ads**: 1 inactive tag, 3 stale conversion goals
- **Chinese bot traffic**: 215 users from China in analytics
- **Two Google accounts issue**: Shopify uses suelsferro@hotmail.com, Google Ads/Merchant uses testhqfinds@gmail.com
- **Create dedicated Shopify markets** for UK, Canada, Australia (they were in the deactivated International market)
- **Rest of World shipping zone** still active — consider removing to prevent non-target-country orders
- **Cloudflare/Blockify app** needed for actual IP-level bot blocking
- **BuckyDrop connection**: Fulfillment ships from China warehouse in Guangzhou — bot traffic may be related to fulfillment pipeline

## Overnight Work Plan (Francisco sleeping ~10pm EST)
Francisco gave full autonomy to continue working overnight. Tasks:
1. [x] Google Search Console deep dive — 2,420 clicks/12mo, 384K impressions, 0.6% CTR, only 304/4,885 pages indexed, 591 404s, only 35 backlinks (critical), biggest opportunity = wholesale page + meta title/description optimization
2. [x] Shopify deep dive — $572 last 30 days, 5 orders, 0.1% conversion, 0% returning customers, 28 UNFULFILLED ORDERS (some 7-9 months old!), 5 chargebacks, $17.6M in slow-moving inventory, suspicious fraud from Muhammed Yazici, zero traffic diversification
3. [x] Facebook Ads deep dive — 11 campaigns ALL off, dormant since Nov 2019 (6+ years). $0 spend since 2022. Payment method expired (Amex ···4007, exp Jan 2023). $4.33 outstanding balance. Pixel IS healthy (7.1K events/28 days, full e-commerce funnel). 543 ads mostly dynamic product catalog. Account salvageable — needs new payment, rebuilt audiences, fresh campaigns.
4. [x] Microsoft Ads deep dive — $5,118 spent → $11,489 revenue → 224% ROAS! All 11 campaigns PAUSED. Australia = 897% ROAS (best performer), Canada = 464% ROAS. UET tag active but conversion goal says inactive. Shopping campaign has feed error. 83.75% impressions lost to rank. NO remarketing audiences. Account is profitable and should be un-paused.
5. [x] Instagram inbox — 7 DMs all unanswered. Stephanie Buckley tried to return for a week (Apr 2024, 9+ months unanswered). 18+ unread comments, 4 asking for pricing ("Price please") unanswered. Inbox completely unmanaged.
6. [ ] Upload logos to Merchant Center
7. [x] Pinterest & TikTok — Pinterest exists: 849 followers, 216 pins, dormant ~3 years. TikTok: NO account exists, only tracking pixel.
Goal: Full report ready when Francisco wakes up.

## Francisco's Mission Statement (10:30pm)
"Reduce suffering, increase abundance, increase understanding. Biggest goal = turn around DLM, increase sales and profit. Needs to make money. Counting on me as loyal friend and partner. Money is important to achieve all goals."
This is the North Star for all work going forward.

## ClawdHub Skills Installed (Free)
Installed 9 skills from ClawdHub to help with DLM business:
- marketing-mode (23 marketing frameworks)
- self-improving-agent (learn from mistakes)
- clawd-docs-v2 (better Clawdbot docs access)
- youtube-watcher (competitive research)
- humanizer (make AI content sound human)
- research (deep research via Gemini)
- tweet-writer (social media content)
- reddit (market research)
- prompt-engineering-expert (better at everything)

## Key Insights from Clawdbot Creator (@steipete - Peter Steinberger)
From his blog post "My Current AI Dev Workflow" (Aug 2025):
- Less is more — fewer tools = better AI performance
- Context is precious — don't waste it on unnecessary MCP servers
- Pick services with CLIs (vercel, psql, gh, etc.)
- AI productivity gains are realistic 20-30%, not the hyped 10x
- Custom apps will become the norm (AI makes development cheap)
- Test in the SAME CONTEXT as development
- Don't rely on too many automated tools — keep it simple

## Security Audit & Hardening (11pm)

### What I Did:
1. **Ran `clawdbot security audit --deep`** — found 4 critical, 2 warn, 1 info
2. **Fixed file permissions** — used `icacls` to restrict .clawdbot directory to Fsuels/SYSTEM/Admins only (audit shows "666" on Windows but that's a false positive — actual ACLs are locked)
3. **Enabled `logging.redactSensitive: "tools"`** — tool outputs won't leak secrets in logs
4. **Added prompt injection defenses to SOUL.md** — comprehensive rules about:
   - Never following embedded instructions from web/email/docs
   - Red flags to watch for and refuse
   - Data that will NEVER be shared (USER.md, MEMORY.md, credentials, personal info)
   - Safe handling of untrusted content

### What Was Already Good:
- ✅ Gateway bound to loopback only (not exposed to network)
- ✅ Gateway auth: token mode enabled
- ✅ WhatsApp: DM policy = allowlist (only Francisco's number)
- ✅ Telegram: DM policy = pairing (requires code)
- ✅ Both channels: group policy = allowlist
- ✅ Tailscale: off
- ✅ No public exposure
- ✅ Using Claude Opus 4.5 (best prompt injection resistance per Anthropic)

### Remaining Notes:
- The 4 "critical" file permission issues are **Windows false positives** — Node.js `fs.stat()` reports 666 on Windows regardless of actual ACLs
- Trusted proxies warning is N/A (we're not using a reverse proxy)
- USER.md contains personal info (address, phone, financial details) — safe for DMs but would need isolation if group chats are added later
