## 6. Critical Issues & Red Flags 🚨

### 1. **Extremely Low Conversion Rate (0-0.1%)**
- 2,358 sessions in 30 days → only 5 orders
- Industry average for apparel is 1.5-3%
- This is 15-30x below industry standard

### 2. **Zero Customer Retention**
- 0% returning customer rate across all cohorts
- No repeat buyers in 8+ months of data
- 15,313 "customers" but mostly email subscribers, not buyers

### 3. **Massive Unfulfilled Order Backlog**
- 28 orders to fulfill
- Some orders 7-9+ MONTHS old and still unfulfilled
- This will lead to more chargebacks and negative reviews

### 4. **Chargeback Problem**
- 5 chargebacks identified in visible orders
- 3 lost ($380.78 in losses)
- 1 open, 1 submitted
- Chargeback rate appears high relative to order volume

### 5. **Inventory vs Sales Mismatch**
- Tens of thousands of units in stock across products
- Only ~50 orders in 9 months
- 0% sell-through rate
- $17.6M in "C" inventory (slow-moving) vs $0 in "A" inventory

### 6. **No Diversified Traffic Sources**
- No social media traffic
- No paid advertising traffic
- No email marketing driving sales
- Nearly all direct/unattributed

### 7. **Suspicious Fraud Pattern**
- Muhammed Yazici: 4 orders, 2 refunds, 2 chargebacks
- Pattern consistent with friendly fraud or card testing

---

## 7. Recommendations

1. **URGENT: Fulfill or cancel/refund all orders older than 30 days** — Orders from June and April 2025 still unfulfilled is unacceptable
2. **Address the chargeback** that needs response immediately
3. **Investigate Muhammed Yazici** orders for fraud patterns
4. **Drive traffic through marketing** — Set up email campaigns, social media ads, Google Shopping
5. **Improve conversion** — Site may need UX improvements, trust signals, better product photography
6. **Reduce inventory** or adjust ordering — Sitting on massive inventory with 0% sell-through
7. **Implement abandoned cart recovery** — Email is already set up but needs to be reviewed
8. **Set up retargeting** — Install Facebook Pixel, Google Ads remarketing
9. **Review pricing strategy** — AOV around $64 is decent but volume is the issue
