# Memory Log — January 28, 2026

## Late Night Session (2:25 AM - 3:00 AM)

### Mission Control Dashboard Updates
- Moved Gateway link inside status bar as "⚙️ Control" next to health indicator
- Francisco asked me to research Twin.so for inspiration
- **Twin.so launched TODAY** — Hugo Mercier (@hugomercierooo) dropped launch thread
  - 1.3M views, 3.7K replies, $10M seed round, 100K+ agents deployed in beta
  - "The AI company builder" — describe automations in plain language, agents run them
  - Human-like memory, smart model switching (Opus for planning, cheap for execution)
  - Growth hack: "RT and comment 'Twin' for free credits in your DMs"

### Francisco's Vision: Digital Company
- Each skill = a digital employee with name, role, avatar, persona
- Built **team.json** with 8 specialist team members:

  - 📈 The Intern (QA & Improvement) — claude-sonnet-4
- Built new Activity view with team grid, orchestrator bar, live stats footer
- Activity tab renamed to "Team" — now default landing tab

### Francisco's Overnight Directive (2:48 AM)
**"Never idle. Always improving. You are going to be the best bot in the world."**

Key problems to solve (Council-grade):
1. **Memory** — never forget important stuff, always stay on top of things
2. **Task completion guarantees** — nothing falls through cracks
3. **Best-in-class design** — dashboard, system, experience
4. Council must debate and reimagine these solutions
5. Cutting edge — best of the best, new solutions to unsolved problems

Francisco went to sleep. Directive: continue working, never idle, always improving.

### Git Activity
- Committed: agent dashboard, sync script, team roster, activity view redesign
- All pushed to github.com/fsuels/FsuelsBot
