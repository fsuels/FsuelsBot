# Memory Log — January 28, 2026

## Late Night Session (2:25 AM - 3:00 AM)

### Mission Control Dashboard Updates
- Moved Gateway link inside status bar as "⚙️ Control" next to health indicator
- Francisco asked me to research Twin.so for inspiration
- **Twin.so launched TODAY** — Hugo Mercier (@hugomercierooo) dropped launch thread
  - 1.3M views, 3.7K replies, $10M seed round, 100K+ agents deployed in beta
  - "The AI company builder" — describe automations in plain language, agents run them
  - Human-like memory, smart model switching (Opus for planning, cheap for execution)
  - Growth hack: "RT and comment 'Twin' for free credits in your DMs"

### Francisco's Vision: Digital Company
- Each skill = a digital employee with name, role, avatar, persona
- Built **team.json** with 8 specialist team members:
  - 🔬 Deep Dive (Research Analyst) — gemini-2.5-pro
  - ✍️ Wordsmith (Content Creator) — claude-sonnet-4
  - 🎭 The Humanizer (Editor-in-Chief) — claude-sonnet-4
  - 🏛️ The Council (Board of Advisors) — multi-ai
  - 💻 Code Monkey (Software Developer) — claude-sonnet-4
  - 🐙 Git Guardian (DevOps Engineer) — claude-sonnet-4
  - 🧠 Prompt Architect (AI Engineer) — claude-opus-4.5
  - 📈 The Intern (QA & Improvement) — claude-sonnet-4
- Built new Activity view with team grid, orchestrator bar, live stats footer
- Activity tab renamed to "Team" — now default landing tab

### Francisco's Overnight Directive (2:48 AM)
**"Never idle. Always improving. You are going to be the best bot in the world."**

Key problems to solve (Council-grade):
1. **Memory** — never forget important stuff, always stay on top of things
2. **Task completion guarantees** — nothing falls through cracks
3. **Best-in-class design** — dashboard, system, experience
4. Council must debate and reimagine these solutions
5. Cutting edge — best of the best, new solutions to unsolved problems

Francisco went to sleep. Directive: continue working, never idle, always improving.

### Git Activity
- Committed: agent dashboard, sync script, team roster, activity view redesign
- All pushed to github.com/fsuels/FsuelsBot

### 🧠 Memory System Built (3:10 AM - 3:30 AM)
**Top priority per Francisco (03:09 AM): "Memory is paramount. Must be perfect."**

Implemented the Council's memory architecture (from council-sessions/2026-01-28-ultimate-agent-system.md):

**Layer 2 — Event Ledger:**
- Created `memory/ledger.jsonl` — append-only, immutable source of truth
- Backfilled 55 structured events from USER.md, MEMORY.md, and daily memory files
- Schema: ts, id, type, priority, content, entity, tags, source, session
- 10 event types: fact, decision, preference, commitment, constraint, procedure, relationship, insight, milestone, conflict
- Priority P0-P3 with retention rules (P0 permanent, P3 archive after 30 days)
- Distribution: 10 P0, 35 P1, 10 P2. 22 facts, 11 milestones, 5 constraints, 4 decisions, 4 commitments, etc.

**Layer 3 — Knowledge Base:**
- Created `knowledge/` with 4 subcategories:
  - `entities/` (4 files): francisco.md, dress-like-mommy.md, buckydrop.md, fsuels-bot.md
  - `procedures/` (4 files): memory-system.md (master doc), session-startup.md, memory-consolidation.md, recall-pack-generation.md
  - `principles/` (4 files): budget-rules.md, proactivity.md, security-rules.md, tool-selection.md
  - `insights/` (2 files): system-stability.md, windows-environment.md

**Layer 4 — Recall Pack:**
- Created `recall/pack.md` — the session context injection document
- 680 words (limit 3,000) — includes P0 constraints, open commitments, waiting-on items, today's focus, active context
- Created `recall/triggers.json` — 9 trigger patterns for context-aware knowledge loading (future enhancement)

**Automation:**
- Created memory-consolidation cron job (3 AM daily) — spawns sub-agent to extract events, update knowledge, rebuild recall pack
- Updated AGENTS.md with new 4-layer memory system documentation and startup procedure (recall/pack.md is now step 3)

**Design Decisions:**
- Files Claude can read/write natively (markdown + JSON + JSONL, no databases)
- Append-only ledger for immutability
- Sub-agents for maintenance (not external Python scripts)
- Evolve from current system (nothing destroyed, layers added on top)
- Recall pack solves context window problem (curated 680 words beats random 50K)

### Francisco's Directives (3:09 AM - 3:24 AM)

**3:09 AM:** "Memory is paramount! This is critical work. Make sure to create a plan. Work step by step. Think hard. Do not make any mistakes. This is top priority."

**3:10 AM:** "Any doubts you consult with the counsel" — Standing order: use Council for any design uncertainty.

**3:12 AM:** "I want the best possible solution. Be creative think outside the box. We are creating cutting edge technology inventing new better ways to do things."

**3:13 AM:** "Always aiming to do more with less. Always having the best and smartest way to solve this." — New P0 principle: efficiency = intelligence. More with less. Logged to ledger as EVT-20260128-007.

**3:24 AM:** "After you complete this, I want you to explain in detail to the council exactly what we have and have the council debate improvements ideas. I want you to do this loop 3 times. After each council completion you do the same plan and implement improvements if any are possible. We want the best of the best in the world. We want cutting edge new technology. We are inventing the future."

**3:24 AM:** "Remember never be idle"

### Creative Memory Innovations Proposed (3:12 AM)
Beyond the Council's consensus, proposed 5 cutting-edge innovations:
1. **Memory Chains** — Events link to related past events, forming associative recall chains
2. **Predictive Recall** — Pack adapts based on session patterns (time of day, day of week, topics)
3. **Memory Confidence Decay** — Facts get confidence score that drops over time, flagging stale info
4. **Session Fingerprinting** — Compact signature per conversation builds pattern model
5. **Live Extraction** — Extract events to ledger in real-time during conversations, not just at 3 AM

### Live Extraction Activated
- First live extraction: logged "more with less" principle to ledger mid-conversation (EVT-20260128-007)
- Updated knowledge/procedures/memory-system.md with live extraction section
- This is now standard practice — important events logged immediately, not waiting for consolidation

### 3-Round Council Improvement Loop (Launched 3:24 AM)
Francisco ordered 3 iterations of the improvement loop:
- **Round 1:** Council evaluates 5 innovations + open brainstorm (RUNNING — sub-agent council-memory-innovations, querying Grok/ChatGPT/Gemini)
- **Round 2:** Implement Round 1 results → explain updated system to Council → get more improvements
- **Round 3:** Implement Round 2 results → explain final system to Council → stress-test and final refinements
- Each round: Council debates → I implement → document new state → launch next Council
- Sub-agent session: agent:main:subagent:18f50e4e-59b5-437a-8b96-3a1a92088ad3

### Git Commit
- Committed 25 files (1,757 lines) at 3:30 AM
- Message: "feat: implement 4-layer memory system (Council architecture)"
- Pushed to github.com/fsuels/FsuelsBot

### Session State at Compaction
- Council Round 1 in progress (~41K tokens, querying AIs via browser + Gemini CLI)
- Waiting for Round 1 completion to implement + launch Round 2
- Recall pack enriched to ~1,000 words (added procedures, account IDs, system status sections)
- Francisco went to sleep ~3:24 AM

### Council Round 1 COMPLETED (~3:40 AM)
- Grok + ChatGPT evaluated 5 innovations (Gemini CLI unresponsive)
- **Approved:** Live Extraction, Confidence Decay, Memory Chains (all unanimous)
- **Novel ideas adopted:** Delta Recall Pack (core+delta split), Open Loops Ledger, Supersession Protocol
- **Deferred:** Session Fingerprinting (redundant with ledger), Predictive Recall (needs stable patterns)
- **Killed:** Reconsolidation Reflections (drift risk), Insight Cross-Pollination (too few events)
- Full results: council-sessions/2026-01-28-memory-innovations.md

### Council Round 1 IMPLEMENTED (~3:45 AM)
**Memory system upgraded to v2:**
1. **Delta Recall Pack** — Split into `recall/core.md` (stable, ~200 words) + `recall/delta.md` (rolling, ~500 words) + `recall/pack.md` (combined view). Consolidation only rebuilds delta. "More with less."
2. **Confidence Decay** — Knowledge facts tracked with `[verified: date]`. >30 days = stale warning, >60 days = dropped from pack. Preferences/principles don't decay.
3. **Open Loops** — Commitment events have `status: open/closed`. Delta pack surfaces top 3 oldest open commitments. Prevents things falling through cracks.
4. **Memory Chains** — Events link via `related` field (ID array). Write-time linking during live extraction.
5. **Supersession Protocol** — New facts that correct old ones include `supersedes` field. Recall pack auto-excludes superseded events. Memory self-cleans.
6. **Live Extraction formalized** — `source: "live"` distinguishes real-time events. Consolidation skips already-extracted events.
- Updated: memory-system.md, memory-consolidation.md, recall-pack-generation.md, consolidation cron job
- Git committed: "feat: implement Council Round 1 innovations" (8 files, 410 insertions)

### Council Round 2 LAUNCHED (~3:46 AM)

## Council Round 3 Results & Implementation (3:55 AM - 4:10 AM)

### Council Round 3 Complete
- All 3 AIs (Grok, ChatGPT, Gemini) stress-tested the memory system
- **Grade: B-** (design is A-tier, execution is brittle at scale)
- **Consensus:** Works at 67 events, will break silently at 150-400 events
- Session saved: `council-sessions/2025-07-28-memory-system-round3-final.md`

### Standing Orders from Francisco
1. **Adaptive Council rounds** — up to 6 rounds (was fixed 3). Continue if progress, stop when gains plateau.
2. **All 3 AIs agree = implement** — unanimous Council consensus gets implemented immediately without asking.

### Changes Implemented (all 6 Council consensus items)
1. **Ledger compaction** — monthly compression when >150 events, archives old events, keeps active ledger lean
2. **Deterministic pack builder** — fixed section order, word budgets per section, explicit inclusion rules, conflict detection
3. **Cut 7-Day Forecast** — removed from pack and consolidation procedure (speculative noise wasting budget)
4. **Simplified indexes** — deleted entities.json and tags.json, kept only open-loops.json
5. **Weekly full rebuild** — new cron (Sunday 4 AM) rebuilds indexes from scratch
6. **Git versioning** — git commit before every consolidation run = free rollback

### Files Modified
- `knowledge/procedures/memory-consolidation.md` — removed forecast, added compaction + git steps, simplified indexes
- `knowledge/procedures/memory-system.md` — removed forecast, added compaction/git/rebuild sections, deterministic pack rules
- `skills/council/SKILL.md` — adaptive rounds up to 6
- `recall/pack.md` — removed forecast section, added standing order
- Deleted: `memory/index/entities.json`, `memory/index/tags.json`
- Updated crons: consolidation (git step), biweekly council (adaptive rounds), new weekly-index-rebuild
