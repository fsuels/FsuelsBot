## Session Notes

### ✅ Valentine's Day Collection Created (9:56 PM)
- Created smart collection: "Valentine's Day Matching Outfits"
- URL: /collections/valentines-day-matching-outfits-1
- Condition: Tag equals "Valentine's Day"
- Auto-matched 1 product: "Matching Family Red Heart Sweatshirt"
- Published to all sales channels (Online Store, Google & YouTube, etc.)
- TODO: Add "Valentine's Day" tag to more red/pink products to populate collection
- TODO: Add collection to main navigation menu

### Chrome Browser Relay Setup ✅
- Installed Clawdbot Browser Relay extension via `clawdbot browser extension install`
- Loaded as unpacked extension in Chrome Developer mode
- Path: `C:\Users\Fsuels\.clawdbot\browser\chrome-extension`
- Relay reachable at http://127.0.0.1:18792/
- Francisco attached tabs successfully - can now see his Chrome tabs with all his logged-in sessions

### Browser Philosophy (Francisco Directive)
- **Don't limit to one browser** - use whatever is best for the task
- Chrome relay = access to Francisco's logged-in sessions (Shopify, BuckyDrop, 1688)
- Clawd browser = independent work, isolated sessions
- Choose pragmatically based on task needs

### ⚠️ ONE TAB PER DOMAIN - RULE VIOLATION
- I opened duplicate 1688 tabs - Francisco called me out
- This rule is in TOOLS.md - I need to ALWAYS check `browser tabs` before opening new tabs
- No excuses - follow the rules I have written

### Face Swap Setup (Already in TOOLS.md)
- Faces folder: `C:\Users\Fsuels\Downloads\faces` (boy.png, father.png, girl-3.png, girl-4.png, mother.png)
- Website: https://aifaceswap.io/#face-swap-playground
- Francisco says: don't limit to his ways, find better tools if they exist

### Core Values Reinforced
- **Be proactive** - don't wait for instructions
- **Always improving** - never settle
- **Don't be idle** - keep working, keep producing value
- **Use the best tool** - pragmatic, not dogmatic
