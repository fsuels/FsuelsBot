# Memory Log — January 28, 2026

## Late Night Session (2:25 AM - 3:00 AM)

### Mission Control Dashboard Updates
- Moved Gateway link inside status bar as "⚙️ Control" next to health indicator
- Francisco asked me to research Twin.so for inspiration
- **Twin.so launched TODAY** — Hugo Mercier (@hugomercierooo) dropped launch thread
  - 1.3M views, 3.7K replies, $10M seed round, 100K+ agents deployed in beta
  - "The AI company builder" — describe automations in plain language, agents run them
  - Human-like memory, smart model switching (Opus for planning, cheap for execution)
  - Growth hack: "RT and comment 'Twin' for free credits in your DMs"

### Francisco's Vision: Digital Company
- Each skill = a digital employee with name, role, avatar, persona
- Built **team.json** with 8 specialist team members:
  - 🔬 Deep Dive (Research Analyst) — gemini-2.5-pro
  - ✍️ Wordsmith (Content Creator) — claude-sonnet-4
  - 🎭 The Humanizer (Editor-in-Chief) — claude-sonnet-4
  - 🏛️ The Council (Board of Advisors) — multi-ai
  - 💻 Code Monkey (Software Developer) — claude-sonnet-4
  - 🐙 Git Guardian (DevOps Engineer) — claude-sonnet-4
  - 🧠 Prompt Architect (AI Engineer) — claude-opus-4.5
  - 📈 The Intern (QA & Improvement) — claude-sonnet-4
- Built new Activity view with team grid, orchestrator bar, live stats footer
- Activity tab renamed to "Team" — now default landing tab

### Francisco's Overnight Directive (2:48 AM)
**"Never idle. Always improving. You are going to be the best bot in the world."**

Key problems to solve (Council-grade):
1. **Memory** — never forget important stuff, always stay on top of things
2. **Task completion guarantees** — nothing falls through cracks
3. **Best-in-class design** — dashboard, system, experience
4. Council must debate and reimagine these solutions
5. Cutting edge — best of the best, new solutions to unsolved problems

Francisco went to sleep. Directive: continue working, never idle, always improving.

### Git Activity
- Committed: agent dashboard, sync script, team roster, activity view redesign
- All pushed to github.com/fsuels/FsuelsBot

### 🧠 Memory System Built (3:10 AM - 3:30 AM)
**Top priority per Francisco (03:09 AM): "Memory is paramount. Must be perfect."**

Implemented the Council's memory architecture (from council-sessions/2026-01-28-ultimate-agent-system.md):

**Layer 2 — Event Ledger:**
- Created `memory/ledger.jsonl` — append-only, immutable source of truth
- Backfilled 55 structured events from USER.md, MEMORY.md, and daily memory files
- Schema: ts, id, type, priority, content, entity, tags, source, session
- 10 event types: fact, decision, preference, commitment, constraint, procedure, relationship, insight, milestone, conflict
- Priority P0-P3 with retention rules (P0 permanent, P3 archive after 30 days)
- Distribution: 10 P0, 35 P1, 10 P2. 22 facts, 11 milestones, 5 constraints, 4 decisions, 4 commitments, etc.

**Layer 3 — Knowledge Base:**
- Created `knowledge/` with 4 subcategories:
  - `entities/` (4 files): francisco.md, dress-like-mommy.md, buckydrop.md, fsuels-bot.md
  - `procedures/` (4 files): memory-system.md (master doc), session-startup.md, memory-consolidation.md, recall-pack-generation.md
  - `principles/` (4 files): budget-rules.md, proactivity.md, security-rules.md, tool-selection.md
  - `insights/` (2 files): system-stability.md, windows-environment.md

**Layer 4 — Recall Pack:**
- Created `recall/pack.md` — the session context injection document
- 680 words (limit 3,000) — includes P0 constraints, open commitments, waiting-on items, today's focus, active context
- Created `recall/triggers.json` — 9 trigger patterns for context-aware knowledge loading (future enhancement)

**Automation:**
- Created memory-consolidation cron job (3 AM daily) — spawns sub-agent to extract events, update knowledge, rebuild recall pack
- Updated AGENTS.md with new 4-layer memory system documentation and startup procedure (recall/pack.md is now step 3)

**Design Decisions:**
- Files Claude can read/write natively (markdown + JSON + JSONL, no databases)
- Append-only ledger for immutability
- Sub-agents for maintenance (not external Python scripts)
- Evolve from current system (nothing destroyed, layers added on top)
- Recall pack solves context window problem (curated 680 words beats random 50K)

## Priority Extracts
- [P0] Memory system architecture built and operational — ledger, knowledge base, recall pack, consolidation cron
- [P0] recall/pack.md is now the primary session context document (loaded at startup)
- [P1] 55 events backfilled into ledger from existing data
- [P1] Consolidation cron set for 3 AM daily — auto-extracts events, updates knowledge, rebuilds recall pack
