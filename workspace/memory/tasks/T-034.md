# T-034: ERL-lite Reflection Pilot Rollout

## Goal
Ensure Step 6 (live validation example + receipt) is complete and rollout artifacts are durable across session resets.

## Current State
- **Status**: DONE (locally verified)
- **User confirmation**: 2026-02-17 17:51 EST — "Step 6 done"
- **Reported implementation** (quoted from prior message):
  - Added `procedures/experiential-loop-pilot.md`
  - Updated `procedures/reflection-loop.md`
  - Commit: `cf949684b`

## Verified in this session
- ✅ Reminder checkpoint received and acknowledged
- ✅ User confirmed Step 6 done
- ✅ Continuity state captured to memory for clean reset handoff
- ✅ Local repo verification complete: `git show --stat cf949684b` confirmed commit and file changes
- ✅ Verified file locations in current tree:
  - `workspace/procedures/experiential-loop-pilot.md`
  - `workspace/procedures/reflection-loop.md`

## Next Actions
1. Monitor daily KPI entries for 7 days and review trendline at pilot end.

## Notes
- User explicitly requested proactive continuity handling before any reset.
- Daily KPI auto-log has been proactively wired:
  - Log file: `workspace/memory/erl-lite-kpi-log.md`
  - Daily reminder job: `erl-lite-kpi-daily-reminder` (18:10 America/New_York)
- This file is the canonical handoff note for that request.
