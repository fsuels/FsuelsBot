# T-034: ERL-lite Reflection Pilot Rollout

## Goal
Ensure Step 6 (live validation example + receipt) is complete and rollout artifacts are durable across session resets.

## Current State
- **Status**: IN PROGRESS (awaiting local verification pass)
- **User confirmation**: 2026-02-17 17:51 EST — "Step 6 done"
- **Reported implementation** (quoted from prior message):
  - Added `procedures/experiential-loop-pilot.md`
  - Updated `procedures/reflection-loop.md`
  - Commit: `cf949684b`

## Verified in this session
- ✅ Reminder checkpoint received and acknowledged
- ✅ User confirmed Step 6 done
- ✅ Continuity state captured to memory for clean reset handoff
- ⏳ Local repo verification of commit/file state still pending

## Next Actions (first actions after reset)
1. Verify commit exists: `git show --stat cf949684b`
2. Verify file presence/content:
   - `procedures/experiential-loop-pilot.md`
   - `procedures/reflection-loop.md`
3. If verified, mark T-034 COMPLETE and move to `done_today`.
4. Optional follow-up: decide whether to add a daily KPI log file (auto-tracking) or keep manual.

## Notes
- User explicitly requested proactive continuity handling before any reset.
- This file is the canonical handoff note for that request.
