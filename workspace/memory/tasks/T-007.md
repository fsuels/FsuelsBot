# T-007: Continue 123LegalDoc QA Testing

## Goal
Complete QA testing of all document flows on 123LegalDoc.com (EN pages only).

## Current State
- **Status**: DONE
- **Completed**: 2026-02-17 06:50 EST
- **Browser**: openclaw profile on host (port 18800)

## Document Coverage (FINAL)
| Document | State | Sections | Status |
|----------|-------|----------|--------|
| nda | CA | 27 | ✅ VERIFIED |
| residential-lease-agreement | FL | 63 | ✅ VERIFIED |
| independent-contractor-agreement | TX | 15 | ✅ VERIFIED |
| demand-letter-payment | NY | 37 | ✅ VERIFIED |
| vehicle-bill-of-sale | CA | ~33 | ⛔ BLOCKED (T-006) |

## Decisions
- 2026-02-17: Attempted browser QA, gateway connection failed
- 2026-02-17 06:30: Used openclaw profile (not chrome relay) - works

## Open Questions
- RESOLVED: Gateway restart needed? → Use openclaw profile instead of chrome relay

## Good Findings (2026-02-17)
- ✅ State selector works with proper state-specific content
- ✅ NDA shows CA-specific: CCPA/CPRA, SB 331, non-compete void under Bus. & Prof. Code 16600
- ✅ Dropdown selection works correctly
- ✅ Toggle/switch fields have sensible defaults
- ✅ Progress percentage updates in real-time (4% → 7% → 11%)
- ✅ Section completion status updates immediately
- ✅ Document preview panel shows live updates
- ✅ Residential Lease has descriptive section names (jurisdiction, property, landlord, tenant, lease-terms, financial, fees, utilities, rules, maintenance, entry)
- ⚠️ T-001 confirmed: Nav shows camelCase (vehiclesTransfer, businessOperations, contractorWork, personalDocuments)

## Next Actions
1. Continue residential-lease-agreement testing (FL, 63 sections)
2. Test independent-contractor-agreement
3. Test demand-letter-payment
4. Retest vehicle-bill-of-sale date fields (T-006)
