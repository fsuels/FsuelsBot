## Standing Rules

1. Valentine's Day is THE priority until Feb 14

3. Mobile first — 80%+ traffic is mobile
4. Don't add products — cull instead
5. Price for value, not cheap

## 🧠 CURIOSITY ENGINE PROPOSALS (2026-01-31 9PM)

        ↓
   SOUND LOGIC
 VERIFIED EVIDENCE
   NO FALLACIES
```

### Proposal 1: Valentine Pajama Collection Gap
**TPS Score: 15** (Time: 3 × Priority: 5 × Scope: 1)

**EVIDENCE:** Competitor Sparkle In Pink has 4+ Valentine's pajama lines (candy hearts, lipstick kiss, smiley hearts, waffle knit). Web search shows this is a trending category.

**LOGIC:** Pajamas = repeat purchase + family photos + social sharing. DLM has dresses but NO Valentine pajamas.

**PROPOSAL:** Add 2-3 Valentine pajama sets to BuckyDrop ASAP. Target: heart prints, pink/red, soft fabric.

**NOT RECOMMENDED:** Creating new product category (stays within mommy-and-me niche).

---

### Proposal 2: Sweater/Cardigan Gap
**TPS Score: 12** (Time: 3 × Priority: 4 × Scope: 1)

**EVIDENCE:** Sparkle In Pink features cream heart sweaters, pink pearl cardigans. February = cold weather. Current DLM Valentine products are mostly dresses.

**LOGIC:** Cardigans layer over existing products = upsell opportunity. Practical for February weather.

**PROPOSAL:** Add 1-2 heart-themed cardigans to Valentine collection.

---

### Proposal 3: Valentine Collection Navigation Fix
**TPS Score: 20** (Time: 2 × Priority: 5 × Scope: 2)

**EVIDENCE:** T033 shows Valentine link NOT in main navigation. Competitors have dedicated `/collections/valentines` prominently linked.

**LOGIC:** If customers can't find Valentine products, they can't buy them. SEO value from dedicated URL.

**PROPOSAL:** This is already in T033 Step 3 — Francisco needs to add Valentine link to main menu. ESCALATE this as CRITICAL before Feb 10 cutoff.

---

### Anomaly Detected: 10 Days Until Order Cutoff
**Feb 10 shipping deadline = 10 days away.** Valentine tasks should be TOP priority over Ghost Broker until collection is live and visible.
