## Priority Extracts (Nightly Learn)
- [P1] WhatsApp cannot create Telegram-style "bot identity" without a separate WhatsApp-accepted (mobile) number. Google Voice (VoIP) may be rejected as "not a valid mobile number for United States". Evidence: WhatsApp on-phone error screenshot (Telegram msg 9519).
- [P1] Use WhatsApp Desktop automation (Terminator) for outbound-only when privacy required; keep Telegram as the control channel.
- [P2] `whatsapp_login` may report "already linked" to the personal number; verify end-to-end with a test message before claiming success.
- [P2] PowerShell gotchas: markdown tables with `|` should be appended via Python or PowerShell here-strings; and prefer `Select-Object -ExpandProperty FullName` over fragile `ForEach-Object { $_.FullName }` inside heavily-quoted commands.
- [P2] Terminator MCP agent can crash on heavy `get_window_tree` runs (SIGKILL observed); keep macros lean and reuse sessions where possible.
