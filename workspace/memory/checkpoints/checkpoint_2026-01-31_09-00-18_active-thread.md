## Current State
**Session:** Ghost Broker Zero-to-One Execution
**Status:** Roadmap created, channel tasks queued
**Francisco:** Wants real momentum, not just planning

## What Just Happened

### Roadmap Created: `ghost-broker/ROADMAP.md`
- Full current state assessment (what we HAVE vs what's MISSING)
- Zero-to-one milestones defined
- Channel-specific growth strategies (X, Discord, Moltbook, GitHub, Website)
- Daily execution rhythm
- Success metrics with week 1 / month 1 / month 3 targets

### Channel Tasks Created (T157-T162)
| Task | Channel | Priority | Status |
|------|---------|----------|--------|
| T160 | Website Deploy | P0 | BLOCKER - Francisco action |
| T161 | First Transaction | P1 | Proves model works |
| T157 | X Growth | P2 | 3x daily, 50 follows/day |
| T158 | Discord Setup | P3 | Channels, roles, welcome |
| T159 | Moltbook Engagement | P4 | API key ready |
| T162 | GitHub Public Repo | P5 | Credibility signal |

## Current Reality (Honest Assessment)

### Built ✅
- 20-page website (NOT deployed)
- Stripe TEST mode
- Moltbook verified account + API
- X account @GhostBrokerAI
- Discord invite (not structured)
- Smart contracts (not deployed)
- 6 marketing images
- 5 blog posts

### Not Built ❌
- Website NOT live (blocks everything)
- Zero transactions (no proof it works)
- Zero paying users
- Low social following
- Empty Discord
- No testimonials

## Next Actions (In Order)

### 1. DEPLOY WEBSITE (Francisco)
```powershell
cd C:\dev\FsuelsBot\workspace\ghost-broker\website
npx wrangler pages deploy . --project-name=ghost-broker
```

### 2. First Transaction (After deploy)
- Find or manufacture first client
- Complete full cycle: client pays → agent delivers → payment released
- Screenshot everything

### 3. X Growth (Parallel)
- Start 3x daily posting from @GhostBrokerAI
- Reply to viral agent economy threads
- Follow 50 relevant accounts daily

### 4. Discord Setup
- Create channel structure
- Add roles
- Post welcome message
- Link everywhere

## Key Insight

Francisco is right: **we've been planning, not shipping.**

The roadmap acknowledges this and prioritizes EXECUTION:
- Deploy first
- Get first transaction second
- Everything else follows

Zero to one = one real transaction. Until then, it's all theory.
