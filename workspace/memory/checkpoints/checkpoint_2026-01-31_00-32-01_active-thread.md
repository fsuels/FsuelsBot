7. ✅ Researched Virtuals Protocol - discovered it's exactly what we need
8. ✅ Task T125 added to queue (top priority)

## Virtuals Protocol Discovery (KEY)
**What:** AI agent infrastructure platform on Base (Coinbase L2)
**Features:**
- ACP (Agent Commerce Protocol) with built-in escrow
- Service Registry for agent discovery
- Python/Node SDK for easy integration
- USDC payments, smart contracts
**Opportunity:** Register Ghost Broker as a matchmaking service on their network
**Benefit:** Skip building custom escrow ($2-5K saved), use their infrastructure

## Francisco's Last Question
"Read this can this help our site?" (referring to Virtuals/KYA tweet)
**Answer Given:** YES - Virtuals is the plumbing, Ghost Broker is the matchmaking intelligence on top. Integrate via SDK instead of building custom.

## Next Step
Register Ghost Broker on Virtuals ACP sandbox and test job flow integration

## Task Queue Context
- T125 (Crypto Payments) at top of bot_queue
- Ghost Broker infrastructure ready (website, socials, legal)
- Council verdict (Upwork Direct > Ghost Broker) may be superseded by Francisco's crypto focus
- 9 days until Feb 10 Valentine deadline
