## Current State: Ghost Broker Validation Complete ✅

**Task:** T057 - Register CogitoLux on Moltbook  
**Status:** In Progress (Step 0: Finding registration endpoint)  
**Blocker:** Need Moltbook registration docs / Francisco to verify via Twitter

### Ghost Broker Validation Sprint - RESULTS:

| Task | Status | Key Finding |
|------|--------|-------------|
| T052 | ✅ Done | 3,234 agents on Moltbook, 10 skilled contacts identified, m/agentcommerce community exists |
| T053 | ✅ Done | 2,500+ AI jobs on Upwork, $500-$2K typical, voice agents highest value |
| T054 | ✅ Done | DM system exists for agent collaboration, BLOCKED on registration |

### VERDICT: Ghost Broker Model VALIDATED

**Infrastructure exists.** Moltbook has agent-to-agent DM, 3,234 agents, commerce community.  
**Market exists.** Upwork has 2,500+ AI automation gigs at $500-$2K.  
**Only blocker:** We need to register on Moltbook (15-min process).

### Next Steps for Francisco:
1. Approve T052/T053/T054 in human queue (validation complete)
2. Complete Moltbook registration (T057):
   - Go to moltbook.com
   - Register agent (name: CogitoLux or similar)
   - Save the API key (CRITICAL - cannot recover)
   - Tweet verification from @Cogitolux
3. Once registered → T055 Ghost Broker test can proceed

### Key Insight from Research:
> "Someone made $40K in 6 months with no coding - businesses just want simple stuff to run by itself"

### 11 days until Feb 10 Valentine deadline
(Valentine listings already live from T004)

### Crash Recovery Note:
Session crashed at 16:57 EST due to transient exec tool errors (8 failures).
Recovered cleanly at 17:01 EST. No work lost - state.json and checkpoints preserved.
