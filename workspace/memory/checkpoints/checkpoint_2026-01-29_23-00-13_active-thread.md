## Current State: Phase 2 Product Imports

**T033: Import 7 products from 1688 → BuckyDrop → Shopify**

Francisco provided 7 1688 URLs for Phase 2 import:

### URLs:
1. ✅ https://detail.1688.com/offer/853944666153.html — Added to BuckyDrop Product List
2. ⏳ https://detail.1688.com/offer/969885791145.html
3. ⏳ https://detail.1688.com/offer/934291597297.html
4. ⏳ https://detail.1688.com/offer/979076019926.html
5. ⏳ https://detail.1688.com/offer/862560576658.html
6. ⏳ https://detail.1688.com/offer/980618496327.html
7. ⏳ https://detail.1688.com/offer/971972174266.html

### Product 1 Pricing (Family Matching Outfit - Wool Lamb):
- Product: ¥63-99 ($8.86-13.92)
- Domestic ship: ¥5
- Platform fee: ¥5.5
- Value-added: ¥13.1
- Base total: ~$12.18 (before intl shipping)
- Est. intl shipping: ~$7
- **Total cost: ~$19**
- **Min price (×1.5): ~$28.50 → $29.99**
- ⚠️ Min order: 2 units

### Workflow (Council Verdict):
Browser automation is SLOW (10+ min/product). Council confirmed:
- **Human pilots** — Francisco does visual navigation
- **AI copilots** — I handle pricing, SEO, content

### Current Division:
- **Francisco:** Speed-run remaining 6 imports → push all 7 to Shopify as drafts
- **Bot:** Calculate pricing for all, draft SEO titles/descriptions, polish in Shopify

### Key Learnings Today:
1. Browser automation speed ceiling — human faster for visual tasks
2. "Recurring Problem Protocol" added to SOUL.md
3. Council session proved its own thesis (25 min with browser issues)

## Quick Recovery:
If context truncated:
1. Read this file
2. Check state.json for pending URLs
3. Product 1 is in BuckyDrop Product List
4. Waiting on Francisco to import remaining 6 or confirm workflow
