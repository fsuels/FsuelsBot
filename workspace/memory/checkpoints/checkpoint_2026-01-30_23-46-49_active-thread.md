## Current State
**Session:** Heartbeat recovery after crash
**Status:** IDLE - Ghost Broker website complete, LEARN cron done
**Council Verdict:** Upwork Direct > Ghost Broker for <7 day revenue

## What Just Happened
1. ✅ Session crashed 17 minutes ago due to browser automation timeout
2. ✅ Crash detected and logged to `memory/crash-reports/2026-01-30-225335.json`
3. ✅ Learning logged: Browser typing has 8-second timeout, use Gemini CLI for long queries
4. ✅ T115 (Agent Vetting Criteria) completed, moved to done_today
5. ✅ Health state updated, Mission Control running

## Crash Root Cause
Browser automation tried to type a multi-paragraph Council query into a web-based AI.
- Browser relay had no tab connected
- Typing timeout (8 seconds) exceeded for long text
- **Fix:** Use Gemini CLI for long-form AI queries, not browser-based interfaces
