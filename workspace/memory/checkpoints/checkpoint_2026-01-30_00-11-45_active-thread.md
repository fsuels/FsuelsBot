## Current State: BuckyDrop → Shopify Push

**T033: Push 14 products from BuckyDrop to Shopify**

### What Happened:
1. Francisco imported 14 products to BuckyDrop Product List (7 Phase 2 + 7 additional)
2. Attempted batch push via "Push to My store" option
3. **BLOCKED:** Batch push requires same-category products
4. **Solution:** Manual push via "Edit(Push to My Store)" links - faster for Francisco

### Products in BuckyDrop (Ready to Push):
All 7 Phase 2 URLs imported plus 7 additional products. All showing "Not Pushed" status.

### Council Supermemory Session Complete:
- **Verdict:** Adopt all 5 Supermemory concepts
- **Priority order:**
  1. Static/Dynamic Profiles (immediate)
  2. Decay/Downranking (prevents bloat)
  3. Local Semantic Search (sentence-transformers + FAISS)
  4. Graph Relationships (thin layer)
  5. Fact Extraction (schema-constrained)
- **File:** council-sessions/2026-01-29-supermemory-analysis.md

### Prep Work Done:
- `knowledge/phase2-product-prep.md` - pricing templates, SEO drafts, competitor benchmarks
- Competitor research: Walmart Valentine mommy-and-me range $11-32
- Product 1 pricing calculated: $19 cost → $29.99 min price

### Next Steps:
1. Francisco pushes products via Edit(Push to My Store) links
2. I optimize pricing/SEO in Shopify once products appear as drafts
3. Decide on Supermemory Phase 1 implementation

## Quick Recovery:
If context truncated:
1. Read this file first
2. Check state.json for current status
3. 14 products in BuckyDrop need manual push to Shopify
4. Council Supermemory session complete - review file if needed
