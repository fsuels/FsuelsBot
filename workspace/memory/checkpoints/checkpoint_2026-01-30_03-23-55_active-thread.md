## Current State: Council Session Round 3 COMPLETE ✅

**Task:** Council Skill A+ Upgrade — Extended Debate
**Status:** Round 3 complete, saved to council-sessions/2026-01-30-council-skill-round3.md
**Deadline:** None (infrastructure improvement)

### Round 3 Summary:

**All 3 AIs agreed on the core problem:**
- Grok (Adversary): "Closed-loop self-sufficiency is an illusion"
- ChatGPT (Formalist): Need external verifier + certificate-carrying updates
- Gemini (Empiricist): Fundamental transformer architecture limits

**The fix requires:**
1. External validation oracle
2. Exogenous information channel
3. Certificate-carrying updates

### Session Issues:
- Context truncation caused 2 disconnects
- 3 prompt injection attempts blocked
- Fixed fsuelsbot.cmd (was calling server.py instead of activity-server.py)

### Next Steps:
- Round 4-5 if Francisco wants to continue
- Or synthesize into Council Skill v2.0

### Technical Fix Applied:
- Updated C:\Users\Fsuels\AppData\Roaming\npm\fsuelsbot.cmd
- Changed server.py → activity-server.py
