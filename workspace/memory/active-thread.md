## Current State
Francisco reviewed the full 4-thinker Council verdict (Musk + Karpathy + Hassabis + Carson synthesis). Architecture for self-improving nightly compound loop fully defined. Waiting for Francisco's go-ahead to start building.

## What Just Happened
- Read Ryan Carson's compound engineering article (X post, 243 bookmarks)
- Ran multiple Council sessions (Elon 5-step, three-visionaries, 4-thinker synthesis)
- Sub-agent Councils had browser reliability issues; ran final Council manually from main session
- Delivered complete architecture verdict covering: nightly loop, TPS scoring, 5 personas, 4-layer output scoring, bounded curiosity, goal hierarchy, deletions

## Pending Actions
1. **Francisco decision needed:** Start building the nightly compound loop?
2. **Elon council implementation:** Delete 4 procedure files, create execution-boundaries.md, embed 5-step in proactivity.md
3. **4-thinker implementation:** Build two cron jobs (10:30 PM learn, 11:00 PM ship), create persona prompts, implement TPS scoring, set up safety gates

## Context for Next Session
- The complete architecture is in this session's conversation + saved to memory/2026-01-28.md
- council-sessions/elon-5step-debate.md has the full Elon Council results
- Valentine's Day is 17 days away — urgency to start shipping DLM work autonomously
