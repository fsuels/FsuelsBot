## Current Work: 100% Memory Reliability System

**Completed this session:**

## Standing Rules
1. Update this file after EVERY significant action
2. Read this file if context seems incomplete
3. Never trust truncated summaries over this file
4. Run memory-integrity.ps1 on heartbeats

## Context Recovery
If context truncates, read this file FIRST. It is the source of truth for what we were doing.
