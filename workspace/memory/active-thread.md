## Current Conversation
Francisco pointed out dashboard was stale — showed Council as "working" when all sub-agents are done. Fixed current-task.json and team.json to reflect reality.

**UNRESOLVED:** Francisco said "I meant wifi" at 1:54 PM — correcting something from the conversation right before compaction. Context lost. Still don't know what this refers to. Need Francisco to clarify.
