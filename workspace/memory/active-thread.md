## Current State: T002 COMPLETE ✅

**Just completed:**
1. ✅ T002 SEO title batch fixes — 220 products updated!
2. ✅ Francisco uploaded CSV, import succeeded
3. ✅ Verified: "Christmas Sweater Red Rocking Horse Knit Top | DLM" matches CSV

## What Happened

Francisco ran the Shopify CSV import with "overwrite existing products" option. I verified by checking a specific product (ID 7462249955425) — title is now exactly what was in our CSV file.

**Impact:** 220 products now have SEO-optimized titles ≤60 chars with "| DLM" branding suffix.

## Next Up: T004 Valentine Listings

Now that SEO titles are done, next task is optimizing Valentine product listings:
- Optimize titles per SEO procedure
- Add urgency copy to descriptions  
- Verify pricing and BuckyDrop source
- Feb 10 deadline (12 days)

## Francisco's Quick Wins (Pending)

- T005: Announcement bar (1 min)
- T006: Hero banner copy (2 min)
- T007: Hide Christmas nav (1 min)
- T008: Valentine on homepage (2 min)
