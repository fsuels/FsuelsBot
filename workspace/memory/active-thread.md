## Current Topic
- Mission Control dashboard UX — Francisco giving live feedback, iterating fast
- Just fixed: expanded cards staying open across live poll refreshes

## What Francisco Wants (Dashboard)
1. ✅ Split layout (team left, feed right) — "I like the split"
2. ✅ Bigger, readable live feed
3. ✅ Clickable task cards with details
4. ✅ Business value ("Why") on every task
5. ✅ Full audit: description, benefit, progress, steps, strategy
6. ✅ Visually polished — gradients, animations, colors
7. ✅ Cards stay open when clicked (persist across poll)
8. ❓ Waiting for Francisco's feedback on latest version

## Council Verdict (just delivered)

## Recent Conversation Flow

6. Visually friendly → gradients, polish
7. Closes when I click → fixed polling state persistence
