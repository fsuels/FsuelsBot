## Current Conversation: Memory Reliability

Francisco emphasized that reliable memory is NON-NEGOTIABLE. I cannot lose track.

**Issue:** Context got truncated, I saw "summary unavailable" but didn't immediately read this file. That's a failure.

**Solution implemented:**
- Added "Context Truncation Recovery" section to AGENTS.md
- Rule: If I see truncated context, STOP and read this file FIRST before responding

## Previous Work: Valentine's Day DLM Prep (COMPLETED)

- ✅ Created "Valentine's Day" smart collection on Shopify
- ✅ Tagged 7 Valentine's products
- ✅ Added "VALENTINE'S DAY" to main navigation menu
- ✅ Pinterest APPROVED — 8,806 products synced

## Standing Rules
1. Update this file after EVERY significant action
2. Read this file if context seems incomplete
3. Never trust truncated summaries over this file

## Context Recovery
If context truncates, read this file FIRST. It is the source of truth for what we were doing.
