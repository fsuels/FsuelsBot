## What We're Doing RIGHT NOW
- **Live product sourcing session on 1688.com** — Francisco is logged in, I can see the browser
- Was about to search 1688 for mommy-and-me products (母女装/亲子装) to find a good product to add
- Francisco wants to walk through the full pipeline: find on 1688 → BuckyDrop → cost calc → price → list on Shopify

## Open Tabs
1. 1688.com (logged in as fsuels)
2. BuckyDrop (Shopify integration, store connected Normal)
3. Shopify Admin (Products page)

## Context
- Francisco documented his full product workflow via voice message — saved to knowledge/procedures/dlm-product-workflow.md
- BuckyDrop ↔ Shopify connection is live and working
- 22 products already researched (dlm-tasks/1688-product-sourcing-jan28.md) but Francisco wants to search live together
- Alicdn images decision: re-host to Shopify CDN, don't delete
- Valentine's collection content ready (dlm-tasks/valentines-collection-ready.md)

## Questions Still Unanswered
1. Where are Francisco's face templates saved? (for model face swapping)
2. Size conversion JS — where is it in the theme? (needs audit, currently broken)
3. BuckyDrop fee structure — flat per order, percentage, or subscription?

## Francisco's Mood
- Energized, wants to make money improving the website
- Frustrated about stale catalog
- Wants me to be hands-on, not just plan
