## Current State: NIGHT SHIFT - FRANCISCO SLEEPING

**Status:** Working independently. Francisco went to sleep at 2:45 AM.

## ✅ COMPLETED THIS SESSION

### Bug Fix - Homepage Opacity
- **Problem:** Homepage images nearly invisible on live site
- **Solution:** Francisco disabled "Reveal on scroll" animation in Theme Settings
- **Result:** Images now fully visible ✅

### Valentine Hero Banner - PARTIAL
- **Done:** Added Image banner section to homepage (at top of Template)
- **Blocked:** Shopify's nested iframes prevent clicking into Heading/Text/Buttons blocks
- **Needs:** Manual copy entry when Francisco wakes up

## 🟡 WAITING FOR FRANCISCO (when he wakes)

**Hero Banner Copy (2 min task):**
In Shopify theme editor, click the Image banner sub-items:
1. **Heading** → `💕 Valentine's Twinning – Order by Feb 10!`
2. **Text** → `Match her love, match her look. Free shipping on all orders.`
3. **Buttons** → `Shop Valentine's` → `/collections/valentines-day-matching-outfits`
4. **Save**

## 🔵 NIGHT SHIFT WORK (in progress)

Working on tasks that don't need Francisco:
- Competitor research
- BuckyDrop import prep
- SEO improvements
- Documentation

## ASSETS READY TO DEPLOY
- ✅ Valentine copy: `knowledge/valentine-copy-drafts.md`
- ✅ Valentine products (10): `knowledge/valentine-products-1688.md`
- ✅ Full backlog: `memory/backlog.md`
- ✅ Turnaround plan: `knowledge/dlm-turnaround-actions.md`

## Backlog (prioritized)
1. 🟡 Hero banner copy (blocked - needs manual)
2. 🔴 Update announcement bar with urgency
3. 🟡 Optimize mobile LCP (12.2s → <2.5s)
4. 🟡 Import Valentine products via BuckyDrop

## Quick Recovery Checklist

If context is truncated:
1. Homepage opacity bug → FIXED ✅
2. Valentine hero banner → Section added, copy needs manual entry
3. Francisco → SLEEPING (went to bed 2:45 AM)
4. Copy ready in knowledge/valentine-copy-drafts.md
5. Products ready in knowledge/valentine-products-1688.md

## Standing Rules
1. Update state.json BEFORE reporting work
2. NORTH STAR: Make the cash register ring
3. I don't sleep. Never limit by human speed.
