## Key Decisions This Session
1. ❌ NO outreach to Moltbook breach victims (ethical risk, vulture optics)
2. ✅ Let Ghost Broker's security positioning speak for itself
3. ✅ Follow relevant accounts (@techNmak) for intel
4. ⏸️ Competition/moonshot idea PARKED until after first transaction

## Session Narrative
The Moltbook security breach + @bored2boar's critique creates a perfect storm for Ghost Broker positioning. The market is waking up to the security problem with AI agent platforms. But Francisco wisely cautioned against exploiting it directly - be the calm alternative that existed before the crisis, not the vulture that shows up during it.

## Next Actions
- Deploy Ghost Broker website (still the blocker)
- Continue X research for agent economy intel
- Position Ghost Broker as secure WITHOUT naming competitors

## Crash Note
Session crashed earlier due to malformed JSON when adding task (escaped quotes). Non-critical - just data handling error. Recovered automatically.
