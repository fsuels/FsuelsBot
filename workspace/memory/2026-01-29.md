## 01:05 - Council Session Complete

### Procedure Compliance System v1.0 Implemented

**Problem solved:** Claude forgetting to read procedures before acting.

**Solution (from Grok + ChatGPT consensus):**
1. Deterministic routing (keyword triggers ? procedure files)
2. Verification gates (must state proof of reading)
3. Self-enforcement in SOUL.md
4. Compliance log tracking

**Files updated:**
- SOUL.md — Added "Procedure Compliance" section with self-check rules
- AGENTS.md — PROCEDURE CHECKPOINT already present, state updated
- procedures/product-listing.md — Added verification gate
- memory/compliance-log.jsonl — Created for tracking
- council-sessions/procedure-compliance-solution.md — Full documentation

**Key insight:** Don't trust AI memory. Force the reminder every time.
