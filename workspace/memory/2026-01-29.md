## 01:05 - Council Session Complete

### Procedure Compliance System v1.0 Implemented

**Problem solved:** Claude forgetting to read procedures before acting.

**Solution (from Grok + ChatGPT consensus):**
1. Deterministic routing (keyword triggers ? procedure files)
2. Verification gates (must state proof of reading)
3. Self-enforcement in SOUL.md
4. Compliance log tracking

**Files updated:**
- SOUL.md � Added "Procedure Compliance" section with self-check rules
- AGENTS.md � PROCEDURE CHECKPOINT already present, state updated
- procedures/product-listing.md � Added verification gate
- memory/compliance-log.jsonl � Created for tracking
- council-sessions/procedure-compliance-solution.md � Full documentation

**Key insight:** Don't trust AI memory. Force the reminder every time.

## 01:30 - Valentine Product Audit (Subagent)

### Subagent Task: Resume Valentine Draft Listings

**Context recovery:** Followed AGENTS.md protocol after context truncation. Read active-thread.md and procedures.

### Findings:

**Valentine Products Already in System (7 total):**

| Product | BuckyDrop Status | Source |
|---------|-----------------|--------|
| Valentine Baby Tutu Romper 3-Piece Set | Unavailable | Unlinked |
| Holiday Heart Family Matching Pajamas | Unavailable | Unlinked |
| Valentine Heart Mommy and Me Matching Pajamas | Unavailable | Unlinked |
| Mommy and Me Sequin Heart Flip Leggings | Available | Unlinked |
| Baby Girl Valentine Romper Set | Available | Unlinked |
| Mommy and Me Valentine Heart Pajama Set | Available | Unlinked |
| Matching Family Red Heart Sweatshirt | Unavailable | Linked (50/50) |

**Key insight:** We have 7 Valentine products but only 1 is fully sourced!

### Discovered Workflow:

**To connect a source:**
1. Go to BuckyDrop > My Store Products
2. Find the product with Unlinked status
3. Click Connect Source
4. Modal opens with URL input field
5. Paste 1688 product URL
6. Click Search
7. Map variants
8. Save

**Current blocker:** 1688 direct search blocked by captcha. BuckyDrop search shows products but cards dont open detail pages.

### Workarounds needed:
1. Manual 1688 search (human clicks through captcha)
2. Use saved 1688 URLs from previous sessions
3. BuckyDrop Find Similar Source feature (untested)
4. Request Scott (BuckyDrop support) to help with sourcing

### Browser Cleanup Done:
- Closed duplicate BuckyDrop tabs
- Closed ChatGPT, Grok, blank tabs
- Left: BuckyDrop, 1688, Shopify Admin, Mission Control

### Recommendation:
The 6 unlinked Valentine products need 1688 source URLs before they can be fulfilled. Francisco may need to:
1. Manually navigate 1688 (bypass captcha with human interaction)
2. OR use BuckyDrops sourcing request form
3. OR contact BuckyDrop support for help finding matching sources
