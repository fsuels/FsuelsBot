## 🔴 URGENT — Respond ASAP

### 1. Peggy Spino (Facebook Messenger)
- **Date:** 3/20/2025 (latest of 3 messages)
- **Category:** ORDER COMPLAINT — REFUND/DELIVERY DEMAND
- **Priority:** 🔴 URGENT
- **Full Messages:**
  - **2/10/25:** "I am still waiting on the order I placed on Dec 10, 2024. I have tried to reach out to you, but I have never gotten a response."
  - **2/20/25:** "Either say the order will arrive at a certain date or say you cannot provide it (from Dec 10) and give me a refund. I am so disappointed. I feel I am being ignored. Needless to say, this grandmother is pretty darn angry."
  - **3/20/25:** "Well, it's been over three months. I sure hope you will send the order to me. I have paid you through my credit card. My granddaughters are still waiting for the matching nightgowns that should have been given to them at Christmas. Please help me to make them happy."
- **Action needed:** Check order from Dec 10, 2024. Either provide tracking/delivery date or issue refund. Customer has sent 3 escalating messages over 5+ weeks. Very frustrated grandmother. Risk of chargeback.
- **Note:** Messaging window may have expired — Business Suite showed "You are no longer able to send messages to this person" at one point, but reply box was visible later.

### 2. Stephanie Buckley (Instagram DM)
- **Date:** 4/19/2024
- **Category:** RETURN REQUEST
- **Priority:** 🔴 URGENT (though old — customer has been waiting 9+ months!)
- **Preview:** "Hello I have been trying to initiate a return ..."
- **Action needed:** Open this conversation and check return details. This is very overdue.

## Recommended Action Plan

### Immediate (Today)
1. **🔴 Peggy Spino** — Look up her Dec 10, 2024 order. Refund or provide tracking. She's sent 3 escalating messages and is threatening credit card dispute. Messaging window may need re-opening via email.
2. **🔴 Stephanie Buckley** — Open her Instagram DM and process her return request from April 2024.

### This Week
3. **Open and read all 6 unread Messenger conversations** (Łukasz Sikora, Patricia Mounier, Michał Kuśmierz, Mirella Mili, Adam Bienkowski, Tina Pelletier Soucier) — they all received only auto-replies.
4. **Check Claudia Hackman's** priority-tagged message.
5. **Scroll through remaining 7+ Instagram DMs** not captured in this report.

### Low Priority / Housekeeping
6. Mark all old Facebook comments (3-5 years) as "Done"
7. Mark all old Instagram "Price please" comments as "Done"  
8. Consider hiding the "DO NOT ORDER" Facebook comment from See See
9. Delete/ignore ANKIT CHANDRAKAR spam messages
