# DLM Logos & Inbox Report — Jan 26, 2026

## Logos Status
- Created properly-sized logos from existing design:
  - **Rectangular**: `dlm-logo-rectangular.png` — 1200x600 (2:1 ratio)
  - **Square**: `dlm-logo-square.png` — 1000x1000 (1:1 ratio)
- Original logo: 779x317px (too small, wrong ratio)
- NOT YET UPLOADED to Google Merchant Center — Francisco needs to upload manually
- **Warning**: Google may reject again because the text is still detailed/thin. If rejected, Francisco should create a simpler version (just dress icon, or bold text only)
