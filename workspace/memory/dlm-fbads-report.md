- **Warm Traffic** — Mid-funnel engagement (multiple conversions)
- **Behavior Based Retargeting** — Bottom-funnel retargeting
- **Products Retargeting** — Dynamic product retargeting (catalog ads)
- **Winter Collections** — Seasonal/collection-specific campaign
- **Reach** — Brand awareness

## 3. Spend History

### Available Billing Data

| Date | Payment Method | Amount | Status |
|------|---------------|--------|--------|
| Nov 30, 2019 | Amex ···· 4007 | $50.85 | Paid |
| Oct 31, 2019 | Amex ···· 4007 | $128.43 | Paid |
| Oct 13, 2019 | Advertising credit | $0.29 | Paid |

**Total visible spend (Oct–Nov 2019):** ~$179.57

| Last 30 days | $0.00 |
| Last 90 days | $0.00 |
| Last 12 months | $0.00 |
| Max available (Dec 2022 – Jan 2026) | $0.00 |
| **All-time (estimated from billing)** | **~$179.57+ (only 3 transactions visible; likely more before Oct 2019)** |

> **Note:** Facebook's maximum reporting lookback goes to ~Dec 2022. All campaigns show $0.00 within this window. The actual historical spend occurred in 2019 and earlier billing records may exist but weren't accessible in the default payment activity view (date range limited + account verification wall).

## 4. Performance Data

### Within Available Reporting Window (Dec 2022 – Jan 2026)
**All metrics are zero** — no campaigns ran during this period.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Results | — |
| Cost per result | — |
| Amount spent | $0.00 |
| Impressions | — |
| Reach | — |
| Clicks | — |
| CTR | — |

### Historical Context (2019 era)
Based on campaign structure and ~$179.57 in visible billing:
- Campaigns ran with objectives: Link Clicks, Website Conversions (Add to Cart, View Content, Purchase), Reach
- The funnel approach (Cold → Warm → Retargeting) suggests a structured ad strategy was in place
- The $128.43 payment in October 2019 was the largest single billing charge visible

**No historical performance metrics are recoverable** — Facebook's data retention only goes back ~37 months in Ads Manager.

## 6. Pixel Health

### Primary Pixel: Dresslikemommy.com's Pixel
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Pixel ID** | 547553035448852 |
| **Status** | ✅ **Active — receiving events** |
| **Total Events (28 days)** | 7,100 |
| **Integrations** | Conversions API + Meta Pixel |
| **Websites** | www.dresslikemommy.com (+2 more) |
| **Connected Catalog** | 1 |
| **Event Match Quality** | ⚠️ **4.5/10** (needs improvement) |

### Events Tracked (Last 28 Days)

| Event | Count | Last Received | Status |
|-------|-------|--------------|--------|
| PageView | 4,800 | 21 minutes ago | ✅ Active |
| View Content | 2,100 | 3 hours ago | ✅ Active |
| Add to Cart | 38 | 4 days ago | ✅ Active |
| Initiate Checkout | 24 | 4 days ago | ✅ Active |
| Search | 13 | 4 days ago | ✅ Active |
| Purchase | 6 | 5 days ago | ✅ Active |
| Add Payment Info | 4 | 9 days ago | ⚠️ No recent activity |

### Daily Event Volume (Chart Data — Last 28 Days)
Events range from ~59/day to ~1,669/day (spike on Jan 20, 2026). Average roughly ~250/day.

### Diagnostics
**1 active issue:**
- **"Confirm domain that belongs to you"** — The domain `shop.app` recently started sending data. Needs to be added to the allowlist. *(This is a Shopify "Shop" app integration — normal behavior)*

### Secondary Pixel
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Pixel ID** | 406906276537460 |
| **Status** | ❌ Inactive — 0 events |
| **Integrations** | None |

### Optimization Recommendations from Meta
1. Connect Conversions API via Shopify → median **13% lower cost per result**
2. Improve rate of pixel events covered by CAPI → **12.7% lower cost per result**

**Bottom line:** The pixel is healthy and actively tracking website activity from the Shopify store. The EMQ of 4.5/10 could be improved by better customer data matching parameters. The 7.1K events show real site traffic.

## 7. Ad Creatives

### Overview
- **543 total ads** in the account
- The vast majority appear to be **product catalog/dynamic ads** ("Default name - Conversions")
- All optimized for **Website Purchase** conversions
- Campaign structures suggest these were **Dynamic Product Ads (DPA)** using the Shopify catalog

### Ad Types (Inferred from Campaign Structure)
| Type | Evidence |
|------|----------|
| **Dynamic Product Ads (Catalog)** | 543 "Default name" ads, Shopify Dynamic Product Audience, connected catalog |
| **Standard Image/Video Ads** | Cold Traffic + Warm Traffic campaigns (likely manual creative) |
| **Collection/Seasonal** | Winter Collections campaign (Nov 2019) |

### Creative Quality Signals
- Campaign names reference a person ("Khush") who likely managed the ad creative
- The retargeting campaigns used product catalog integration
- Cold traffic campaigns focused on link clicks (likely image or video ads to drive traffic)

---

## 8. Best Performing (Historical)

**⚠️ No recoverable performance data** — Facebook's data retention doesn't extend to the 2019 activity period.

### What We Can Infer
Based on the campaign structure and billing data:

1. **Most Active Period:** October–November 2019
2. **Highest Single-Month Spend:** ~$128.43 (October 2019)
3. **Campaign Priorities:** The naming convention and budget allocation suggest:
   - Product retargeting was a key strategy (largest ad count, dedicated campaigns)
   - Cold traffic acquisition was funded ($10/day)
   - Multiple conversion optimization strategies were tested (Warm Traffic, Behavior Based Retargeting)
4. **The Shopify integration** was the backbone — dynamic product ads, audiences, and pixel were all Shopify-connected

## Summary & Recommendations

### Current State: 🟡 Dormant but Salvageable

The account is in good standing with Meta (active, no bans/restrictions) but has been completely inactive for **6+ years**. The pixel is the only functioning asset.

### Key Issues to Address Before Reactivation
1. **Expired Payment Method** — Amex ···· 4007 expired Jan 2023. Must add new payment method.
2. **$4.33 Outstanding Balance** — Small balance needs to be cleared.
3. **Expiring Audiences** — 2 of 3 audiences are being deleted. Need to rebuild.
4. **Discontinued Targeting Options** — Some ad sets use deprecated targeting; need cleanup.
5. **Event Match Quality** — Pixel EMQ is 4.5/10; should improve customer data matching.
6. **Domain Verification** — shop.app needs to be allowlisted in pixel settings.
7. **Account Verification** — Meta is requesting account verification (security check).

### What's Working
- ✅ Account is active and in good standing
- ✅ Primary pixel is healthy and tracking events (7.1K events/28 days)
- ✅ Full e-commerce event funnel is tracked (PageView → Purchase)
- ✅ Conversions API is connected
- ✅ Product catalog is connected
- ✅ Dynamic Product Audience is still ready
- ✅ Shopify integration is functional

### Next Steps to Reactivate
1. Add a valid payment method and clear the $4.33 balance
2. Complete account verification
3. Rebuild custom audiences (website visitors, purchasers, email lists)
4. Create new lookalike audiences from customer data
5. Improve pixel EMQ by adding more customer data parameters
6. Build new campaigns with updated creative
7. Set up Conversions API via Shopify for better optimization
8. Allowlist shop.app domain in pixel settings
