# Memory Log - 2026-01-30

## Session 1 (Overnight)
*Started: ~02:00 EST*

### Council Skill A+ Upgrade
- **Round 3 complete** - All 3 AIs (Grok, ChatGPT, Gemini) converged on same conclusion
- **Core insight:** Closed-loop self-sufficiency is an illusion for LLMs
- **The fix requires:** External validation oracle, exogenous information channel, certificate-carrying updates
- **Session saved:** `council-sessions/2026-01-30-council-skill-round3.md`

### Technical Issues Resolved
