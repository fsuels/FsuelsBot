I built a personal AI memory system for a Claude-based agent. After 3 rounds of Council review and implementation, here is the CURRENT state:

Architecture: 4 layers - daily markdown logs, then append-only JSONL event ledger, then curated knowledge wiki, then recall pack (3000-word session context injection).

Key features (post-Round 3 improvements):
- Append-only ledger with supersession protocol
- 7 event types, P0-P3 priority, type-aware confidence decay
- Incremental nightly consolidation via sub-agent with checkpoints
- Monthly ledger compaction: compress resolved chains, archive when over 150 active events
- Deterministic pack builder: fixed section order, word budgets per section, explicit inclusion and exclusion rules, simple conflict detection
- Only 1 index file (open-loops.json) - everything else derived on-the-fly
- Weekly full index rebuild from scratch (correctness reset)
- Git commit before every consolidation (automatic rollback)
- Memory chains (related events linked by ID)
- Live extraction during conversations
- Knowledge base: entities, procedures, principles, insights directories

Scale: 67 events, 14 knowledge files, files only (no databases, no vector stores, zero dollar budget).
Previous grade: B- (Round 3).

Questions:
1. Grade the UPDATED system (A-F). Has it improved from B-?
2. What are the remaining weaknesses that could cause silent failure?
3. What ONE change would move this closest to an A?
4. Any unnecessary complexity to cut?
5. Contrarian take - something everyone assumes is fine but actually isn't?
