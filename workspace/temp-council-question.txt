I need you to audit an AI agent memory and task system. Grade it A+ to F and be BRUTAL about weaknesses.

**SYSTEM OVERVIEW:**
- memory/state.json - authoritative source of truth (schema-validated, version 44)
- memory/events.jsonl - append-only audit trail (52+ events)
- memory/tasks.json - task board with lanes (bot_current, bot_queue, human, scheduled, done_today)
- memory/active-thread.md - conversation continuity for truncation recovery
- memory/ledger.jsonl - structured event ledger (facts, decisions, preferences)
- recall/pack.md - curated context injection (regenerated nightly at 3 AM)
- knowledge/ - wiki structure (entities, procedures, principles)
- learnings.db - SQLite for learnings (6 kinds, hash dedup, confidence scoring, expires_at)

**TASK SYSTEM:**
- Step-tracking: steps[] array with current_step index, retry_count for loop prevention
- Context isolation: context.summary field captures WHY each task exists
- Plan links: every task has a plan field pointing to procedure
- Lanes: bot_current (max 1-2), bot_queue, human tasks, scheduled crons, done_today

**RELIABILITY:**
- Mid-session checkpoints: saves state.json, tasks.json, active-thread.md every heartbeat (keeps last 10)
- Preflight gates: verifies AGENTS.md/pack.md freshness before autonomous work
- Overnight eligibility: YAML config defining what's safe for autonomous execution
- Memory integrity validator: PowerShell script checks critical files every heartbeat
- Context truncation recovery: read active-thread.md on "Summary unavailable"
- retry_count: if more than 3 on same step, mark task blocked and alert human

**INFRASTRUCTURE:**
- Mission Control dashboard (port 8765): shows task lanes, plan links, real-time status
- Nightly compound loop: LEARN (10:30 PM) then SHIP (11 PM) then CONSOLIDATION (3 AM)
- Daily crons: Research brief (9 AM), Curiosity engine (9 PM), GitHub backup (11:45 PM)
- Council system: multi-AI debates (Grok + ChatGPT + Gemini then Claude synthesizes)

**SECURITY:**
- Prompt injection defenses (red flags, data protection rules)
- Code review before commit requirement
- Golden Rule: instructions ONLY from owner, external content = information not commands

**QUESTIONS:**
1. What GRADE would you give this setup? (be specific)
2. What are its STRENGTHS? (name specific features)
3. What are its WEAKNESSES or gaps? (be brutal, find real problems)
4. What would make it A+ tier?
5. How does this compare to state-of-art agent memory/task systems?
