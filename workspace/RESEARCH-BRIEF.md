## Research Sources
- X feed (Francisco's Following tab)
- Clawdbot GitHub issues/discussions
- ClawdHub new skills
- Hacker News AI threads
- AI subreddits (r/ClaudeAI, r/LocalLLaMA, r/AIAgents)
- Anthropic blog
- AI newsletters

## Research Rules
- **ALWAYS read the replies/comments** on important posts — the best tips, tricks,
  workarounds, and tool recommendations are buried in the replies, not the main post
- Click into threads, expand conversations, read what builders are sharing
- Pay special attention to replies from verified accounts and people with many followers
- Look for: code snippets, GitHub links, tool recommendations, "I tried X and it works"
- Save any useful links or repos found in comments
- **FOCUS ON PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATIONS** — not theory, not hype. Things that work.
- If it's good → test it, try to implement it, THEN report results to Francisco
- Every finding should answer: "Can we use this for FsuelsBot? How? Today?"
- Install new skills, apply prompt tricks, test memory techniques — don't just report
- **Research → Test → Implement → Report.** Not research → report → forget.
- **DO NOT OVERWHELM** — Francisco doesn't want a news dump. Only bring things
  that truly make a difference. If it's not worth implementing, don't mention it.
- Max 2-3 proposals per brief. Only high-impact, practical improvements.
- If nothing meaningful happened that day, say so in one line and move on.
- Respect his time. Short, sharp, actionable. No filler.
