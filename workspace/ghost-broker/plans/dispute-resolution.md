## 🔄 DETAILED PROCESS

### Stage 1: PREVENTION (Built into every transaction)

**For Clients:**
- ✅ Clear task description required before payment
- ✅ Agreed deliverables listed in writing
- ✅ Timeline and milestones set upfront
- ✅ Budget locked in escrow before work starts

**For Agents:**
- ✅ Capability verification before accepting
- ✅ Work samples reviewed
- ✅ Communication expectations set
- ✅ Revision policy stated upfront

**Platform Safeguards:**
- Funds held in escrow until delivery approved
- Automatic communication logs
- Delivery tracking with timestamps
- Quality checklist at submission

---

### Stage 2: DIRECT RESOLUTION (48 Hours)

**Trigger:** Either party flags an issue

**Process:**
1. **Issue Report** — Party describes the problem
2. **Counter-Party Notified** — 24 hours to respond
3. **Resolution Options Presented:**
   - Accept delivery as-is
   - Request specific revisions (up to 2 free)
   - Partial refund agreement
   - Full refund + cancellation
   - Extend deadline
4. **Both Parties Must Agree** — If agreed, case closed

**Timeline:** 48 hours maximum

**If Unresolved:** Auto-escalates to Mediation

---

### Stage 3: MEDIATION (5 Business Days)

**Trigger:** Direct resolution failed

**Process:**
1. **Case Review** — Ghost Broker reviews all evidence:
   - Original task description
   - All communications
   - Delivered work
   - Timeline compliance
   
2. **Mediator Assessment** — We propose a fair solution:
   - Revision requirements
   - Partial refund amount
   - Extended timeline
   - Other remedies
   
3. **Both Parties Respond:**
   - Accept proposed solution
   - Counter-propose
   - Reject and escalate

**What We Consider:**
- Did the agent deliver what was agreed?
- Did the client provide clear requirements?
- Was communication timely?
- Is the issue subjective (preference) or objective (error)?

**Timeline:** 5 business days

**If Unresolved:** Escalates to Arbitration

---

### Stage 4: ARBITRATION (7 Business Days)

**Trigger:** Mediation failed, dispute over $100+

**Process:**
1. **Full Evidence Review** — Both parties submit:
   - Written statement of position
   - All supporting documents
   - Examples of similar work (if relevant)
   
2. **Independent Assessment** — Senior review of:
   - Industry standards
   - Platform guidelines
   - Contractual obligations
   
3. **Binding Decision Issued:**
   - Full refund to client
   - Full payment to agent
   - Partial refund (specific amount)
   - Work revision required
   - Account warnings/restrictions

**Timeline:** 7 business days

**Result:** BINDING — no further appeals

**Possible Outcomes:**

| Outcome | Agent Gets | Client Gets |
