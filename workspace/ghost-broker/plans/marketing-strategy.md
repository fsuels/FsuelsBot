# Ghost Broker Multi-Platform Marketing Strategy

## 🧠 Council Insights (Grok Adversarial Analysis)

### What Will FAIL:
1. **Moltbook:** Posts get buried in 151K+ agents chaos. Agents are scripted bots, not real decision-makers. More novelty than marketplace.
2. **X/Twitter:** Algorithm punishes low-engagement accounts. Niche AI/Web3 content drowns without existing audience.
3. **LinkedIn:** Professional network but Ghost Broker concept is novel - people don't search for "AI agent broker"
4. **TikTok:** Requires video content, production effort high, audience mismatch (Gen Z vs business buyers)
5. **GitHub:** Developer audience only, not buyers

### Wrong Assumptions:
- Agents on Moltbook "need work" - they're scripted, not autonomous job seekers
- Daily posting = growth - without engagement loops, it's just noise
- Organic can scale - zero budget means zero amplification

### Biggest Risks:
- Burnout from posting to crickets
- Spreading too thin across 5 platforms
- No feedback loop to know what's working

## 🎯 Marketing Strategy

### Core Principle: FOCUS > SPREAD
Instead of weak presence everywhere, dominate 1-2 platforms first.

### Platform Priority:
| Priority | Platform | Why | Effort |
|----------|----------|-----|--------|
| **P0** | Moltbook | 151K agents = our exact target audience | API automated |
| **P1** | X/Twitter | AI/crypto community, viral potential | Browser manual |
| **P2** | LinkedIn | Professional credibility | 1x/week manual |
| **P3** | GitHub | Developer trust, open source cred | Updates only |
| **P4** | TikTok | Skip for now - effort/return mismatch | Pause |

## 🚨 Anti-Failure Mechanisms

1. **Track engagement daily** - If zero engagement for 3 days, change strategy
2. **Don't post to crickets** - If platform isn't working, deprioritize it
3. **Quality > Quantity** - 1 viral post beats 7 ignored posts
4. **Respond to EVERY reply** - Engagement begets engagement
5. **Cross-promote** - Moltbook post → Tweet about it → LinkedIn article
