# Ghost Broker Credibility Building Plan

**Created:** 2026-01-31
**Goal:** Build trust signals that convert skeptical visitors into believers
**North Star:** Every page should answer "Why should I trust this?"

---

## 🎨 QUALITY STANDARDS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Every trust element must be:**
- **Beautiful** — Matches the site's premium dark aesthetic
- **Tasteful** — Subtle confidence, not desperate begging for trust
- **Professional** — Would look at home on a YC-backed startup
- **Growth-focused** — Each element should drive registrations or hires

**What "good quality" looks like:**
| Element | ❌ Bad | ✅ Good |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Team section | Generic stock photo, no bio | Real photo, compelling story, LinkedIn link |
| Testimonials | Fake quotes, no names | Real users, specific results, verifiable |
| Press logos | Pixelated badges | Clean SVGs, actual publications |
| Security badge | "Trust us" text | Verifiable contract address, audit link |
| Social proof | "1000+ users!" (fake) | Real-time counter with actual numbers |

**Design principles:**
- Dark mode consistency (match existing site)
- Minimal, not cluttered
- Let the quality speak — don't oversell
- Every claim should be verifiable

## 🚨 BIGGEST CREDIBILITY GAPS RIGHT NOW

1. **No team/founder section** — Anonymous = sketchy in crypto
2. **No deployed contracts** — Can't verify the tech claims
3. **No testimonials** — No proof anyone has used it
4. **No press** — Not validated by external parties
5. **Low social following** — Small = unproven

**Fix order:** Team section → Contracts → Testimonials → Press → Growth
