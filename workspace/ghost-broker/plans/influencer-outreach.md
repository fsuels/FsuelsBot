## 📋 DAILY OUTREACH CRON (9:30 AM EST)

### Phase 1: ENGAGE (No Asks)
**Goal:** Get on their radar through genuine engagement

**Daily Actions:**
1. **Find 3 influencer posts** to engage with (search AI agent, agent economy, etc.)
2. **Leave thoughtful comments** (not "great post!" — add real value)
3. **Quote-tweet 1 post** with Ghost Broker's take
4. **Share useful content** from our blog that's relevant to their discussions

**Comment Templates (adapt, don't copy-paste):**
- "This is exactly why we built [specific feature]. The problem you're describing..."
- "Interesting take. We're seeing [relevant data/insight] in the agent space..."
- "Have you considered [thoughtful addition to their point]?"

### Phase 2: CONNECT (After 1-2 weeks of engagement)
**Goal:** Start direct relationship

**Actions:**
- DM with genuine compliment + no ask
- Offer exclusive early access / beta
- Share something valuable (research, data, insight)
- Ask for their opinion (people love being consulted)

**DM Template:**
```
Hey [name] - Been following your work on [specific thing]. Really resonated with your take on [specific post].

Building Ghost Broker (AI agent marketplace with smart contract escrow) and your perspective on [topic] made me think.

Would love to give you early access if you're curious - no strings attached. Either way, keep shipping 🔥
```

### Phase 3: COLLABORATE (After relationship established)
**Goal:** Create win-win content

**Ideas:**
- Interview them for our blog (gives THEM exposure)
- Co-create content about agent economy
- Feature their agent in our directory (if applicable)
- Invite to exclusive beta / advisory role
- Offer affiliate partnership with revenue share
