**Source:** Ghost Broker First Customer Hunt (2026-01-31)
**Status:** DRAFT - DO NOT SEND WITHOUT FRANCISCO'S APPROVAL

---

## Why This Prospect

**Perfect fit score: 10/10**

- **Exact pain point match:** He said "could get lied to" about AI agents — this is LITERALLY our value prop
- **Has budget:** 3 enterprise deals ready = real money on the table
- **Decision maker:** Building/selling something that needs agent verification
- **Timing:** Active in the space right now

His concern is exactly what Ghost Broker's Agent Observatory solves: **How do you know if an AI agent actually does what it claims?**

## MESSAGE OPTIONS

### Option A: Short X DM (Recommended for first touch)
*~240 characters — punchy, gets to the point*

```
Hey Elliot 👋

Saw your post about agents being able to "lie" to you. Felt that.

We're building third-party agent verification (think Moody's for AI agents). Have data on 37K+ agents.

Want a free evaluation for one of your enterprise deals? No strings.
```

---

### Option B: Longer X DM (If Twitter allows / thread)
*More context, still concise*

```
Hey Elliot,

Your point about "could get lied to" by AI agents really resonated. It's the exact problem we're solving at Ghost Broker.

We run Moltbook integration with 37K+ indexed agents and we're launching an "Agent Observatory" — third-party verification so enterprises don't have to trust agent claims blindly.

Heard you've got enterprise deals cooking. Happy to do a free pilot evaluation on one agent you're considering — real interaction data, trust scoring, the works.

No pitch, no strings. Just want to validate if this solves a real problem before we scale it.

Interested?
```

### Option C: Email Version (If you get his email)
*Full professional pitch*

**Subject:** Third-party agent verification for your enterprise deals

```
Hi Elliot,

I came across your post about how AI agents "could lie" to you about their capabilities — and it stopped me cold. That's exactly the problem we're building to solve.

**The Problem You Named:**
Enterprises are deploying AI agents without any independent way to verify they actually work. It's all trust-based. And as you noted, that trust can be misplaced.

**What We're Building:**
Ghost Broker's "Agent Observatory" — the first third-party evaluation service for AI agents. Think Moody's/S&P ratings, but for autonomous agents.

- We have behavioral data from 37,000+ agents via Moltbook
- We test agents in real multi-agent economic scenarios
- We produce independent reliability reports with actual metrics

**The Offer:**
I heard you have 3 enterprise deals ready where agent trust is a factor. I'd like to offer a **free pilot evaluation** for one agent you're considering.

No sales pitch. No commitment. Just real data on whether the agent does what it claims.

If it's useful, great — we learn from your feedback. If not, you've lost nothing but gained validation data for your deal.

Worth a 15-min call to see if it fits?

Best,
Francisco

## FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY

**If no response in 3 days:**
- Like/reply to one of his recent posts (genuine engagement, not sales)
- Wait 2 more days
- Send follow-up DM: "Hey Elliot — just checking if this landed. Happy to share a sample report if that's more useful than a call. Either way, appreciate your thoughts on the trust problem 🤝"

**If interested:**
1. Schedule 15-min discovery call
2. Understand his specific use case + enterprise deals
3. Propose pilot scope
4. Execute free evaluation
5. Gather testimonial/feedback

---

## WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE

- **Best case:** Pilot → Paid customer → Case study → Referrals
- **Good case:** Pilot → Feedback → "Not now" but warm relationship
- **Minimum viable:** Validation that trust verification is a real paid problem

---

## NOTES FOR FRANCISCO

1. **Timing matters** — he's actively working on deals, don't wait weeks
2. **Option A recommended** — short DMs convert better than walls of text
3. **Be ready to move fast** — if he responds, have calendar link ready
4. **Don't oversell** — we're learning, not pitching
