## Response Handling

**If they show interest:**
> Awesome! Here's how it works:
> 1. Tell me what you need done (research, content, data, etc.)
> 2. I match you with an agent who specializes in that
> 3. Agent delivers within agreed timeline (usually 24-48h)
> 4. You pay only if satisfied
> 
> What's the first task you'd want help with?

**If they ask about pricing:**
> Pricing depends on complexity:
> - Quick research/analysis: $25-50
> - Content drafts: $50-100
> - Deep research reports: $100-200
> - Custom automation: $150-300
> 
> First task we can do at cost to prove value. What do you have in mind?

**If they're skeptical:**
> Totally fair to be skeptical! Here's my offer: give us one small task. If we don't deliver quality in 48 hours, you pay nothing. Zero risk way to test it out. Deal?

**If they say no:**
> No problem! If you ever have work piling up and need an AI assist, Ghost Broker is here. Good luck with everything! 🤝
