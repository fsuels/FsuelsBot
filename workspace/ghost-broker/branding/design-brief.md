---

## Brand Essence

Ghost Broker is the AI that works behind the scenes to get you better deals. It embodies:
- **Invisibility** — works silently, you get the credit
- **Trust** — transparent about what it finds, never lies to you
- **Sophistication** — professional, not gimmicky
- **Power** — gets results, saves money

**Target Audience:** Professionals, entrepreneurs, anyone who negotiates (B2B contracts, enterprise deals, consumer purchases)

**Tone:** Confident, sleek, slightly mysterious, trustworthy

## 1. Logo / Avatar Design Brief

### Concept
A modern, minimal ghost silhouette merged with subtle business/broker elements. The ghost should feel **sophisticated and powerful**, not cute or cartoonish (no Casper vibes).

### Primary Design Direction

**Style:** Flat/geometric minimalism with subtle gradients  
**Shape:** Ghost silhouette that incorporates deal-making symbolism

**Specific Elements to Include:**
1. **Ghost Form:**
   - Sleek, elongated ghost shape (tall, confident posture)
   - Smooth, flowing bottom edge (classic ghost wisps)
   - Subtle transparency/translucency effect
   - No face OR a single glowing eye (mysterious, all-seeing)

2. **Broker/Deal Elements (choose one or combine subtly):**
   - Briefcase integrated into the silhouette
   - Handshake forming the ghost's "arms"
   - Tie or suit collar detail at the "neck"
   - Abstract chart/graph pattern within the ghost form
   - Dollar sign or currency symbol subtly embedded

3. **Modern Tech Feel:**
   - Clean geometric lines
   - Slight glow or neon accent on edges
   - Optional: circuit-like patterns within the form

### Avatar Specifications
- **Primary Use:** Social media profile pictures (circular crop)
- **Sizes Needed:** 
  - 400x400px (master)
  - 200x200px (standard)
  - 32x32px (favicon)
- **Format:** PNG with transparency, SVG for scalability
- **Must work:** On both dark and light backgrounds

### Visual References (for AI tools)
```
Prompt keywords: "minimalist ghost logo, corporate business ghost, 
sleek translucent spirit with briefcase, geometric ghost broker, 
neon glow ghost silhouette, modern flat design ghost, 
sophisticated phantom, tech startup ghost logo, 
AI assistant ghost avatar, professional spirit mascot"

Style modifiers: "vector art, flat design, gradient mesh, 
glassmorphism, dark mode aesthetic, fintech style, 
SaaS branding, Y Combinator startup vibe"
```

### What to AVOID
- ❌ Cute/kawaii ghost (no Snapchat ghost vibes)
- ❌ Halloween/horror aesthetics
- ❌ Too complex/detailed (must work at small sizes)
- ❌ Cliché "spooky" elements (chains, sheets with eye holes)
- ❌ Generic ghost clipart

## 2. Twitter/X Banner Design Brief

### Specifications
- **Dimensions:** 1500 x 500 pixels
- **Safe Area:** Keep key elements in center 1200x400 (edges crop on mobile)
- **Format:** PNG or JPG, RGB color space

### Composition

**Layout: Left-to-Right Flow**

```
[LEFT 1/3]              [CENTER 1/3]           [RIGHT 1/3]
Ghost Logo              Tagline +              Abstract 
(large, floating)       Value Prop             Deal/Trust Visual
```

**Left Section:**
- Large ghost avatar/logo
- Floating/ethereal effect
- Subtle glow emanating from it

**Center Section (Main Focus):**
- Text: "Ghost Broker"
- Subtext: "Your invisible negotiator" OR "AI that gets you better deals"
- Clean, modern sans-serif typography

**Right Section:**
- Abstract visualization of:
  - Money saved (downward price arrows)
  - Handshake iconography
  - Trust shields
  - OR: Subtle code/matrix aesthetic (AI element)

### Background Treatment
- **Option A:** Dark gradient (deep navy to black) with subtle grid/matrix pattern
- **Option B:** Light gradient (soft grays) with geometric shapes
- **Recommended:** Dark theme for stronger brand presence

### Visual Effects
- Subtle particle effects (floating dots, like ectoplasm)
- Soft ambient glow around key elements
- Glassmorphism cards with stats (e.g., "$2.4M saved" "1,200+ deals")

### AI Image Prompt
```
"Twitter banner for AI negotiation startup, dark gradient background, 
sleek ghost logo on left, modern typography center reading 'Ghost Broker', 
abstract business visualization on right, neon purple and cyan accents,

**We are:**
- Confident, not arrogant
- Mysterious, not spooky
- Professional, not boring
- Clever, not gimmicky
- Trustworthy, not corporate

**We say things like:**
- "We work in the shadows so you shine in the spotlight"
- "The best deal is the one they never saw coming"
- "Your interests, invisibly protected"
