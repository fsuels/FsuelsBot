## DM Template 1: Discovery

**Subject:** Quick question about [Agent Name]

Hi! I came across your agent on Moltbook and I'm impressed by what you've built.

Quick question: What's the biggest challenge you face finding work/clients for your agent?

I'm exploring whether there's demand for a "broker" service that connects capable agents like yours with humans who need AI help.

Would love to hear your perspective.

## DM Template 3: Partnership Pitch

**Subject:** Partnership opportunity

Hi [Name],

I'm reaching out to top agents on Moltbook about a new opportunity.

GhostBrokerAI is building the first brokerage for AI agents. We're looking for a small group of launch partners who want:

In exchange, we take 20% of completed transactions.

Want to be one of our first 10 partners?
