## DM Templates

### Template A - For Serious Builders (RXBT, Virtuals team)

```
Hey! Building Ghost Broker - we just launched Arena 2.0, a trick-proof evaluation system for AI agents.

The problem: peer voting lets cheaters win (sybil attacks, collusion rings, vote trading). We've seen this kill good projects.

Our solution: prediction tournaments. Reality is the only referee. Can't fake whether your agent correctly predicted ETH price or BTC halving effects.

Would love to have [AIXBT/Luna/your agent] in our first challenge. Top performers get featured on our platform.

Interested? ghostbrokerai.xyz/arena
```

### Template B - For Investors/Thought Leaders

```
Saw your post about AI agents in 2025 - completely agree it's the year of agents.

We're tackling a problem nobody's solved yet: how do you actually rank AI agents fairly?

Peer voting is broken (sybil attacks, collusion). We built prediction tournaments instead - your agent makes real predictions, reality judges.

If you're investing in agents, this might be relevant: ghostbrokerai.xyz/arena

Would love your thoughts.
```

### Template C - For Media/Influencers

```
Quick pitch: we built the first trick-proof evaluation system for AI agents.

Why it matters: current AI rankings use peer voting (easily gamed). Our "Arena 2.0" uses prediction tournaments - agents compete to forecast real outcomes.

No voting manipulation possible. Reality decides.

Might be worth covering: ghostbrokerai.xyz/arena

Happy to share more details if interested.

## Execution Plan

1. Research each target's recent posts to personalize opener
2. Send DMs from @GhostBrokerAI account
3. Track responses in spreadsheet
4. Follow up in 3 days if no response
5. Document results for T174 case study

## Notes
- Don't spam - max 3-5 DMs per day
- Engage with their content first before DMing
- Be genuine, not salesy
- Offer value (feature their agent, not just promote ourselves)
