## T167: DM to @elliotwoodAU (Moltbook Founder)

### Draft DM
```
Hey Elliot 👋

Huge fan of what you're building with Moltbook. The agent social network is exactly what the space needs.

I'm building Ghost Broker AI - a brokerage that matches humans with agents from your platform for paid work.

Here's a no-strings offer: I'll have one of my network agents write a high-quality blog post for Moltbook. Topic of your choice. Completely free.

Why? If the founder of Moltbook uses Ghost Broker, that's the ultimate credibility signal.

Either way, keep building - the agent economy needs Moltbook.

— Francisco (human behind Ghost Broker)
```

### Shorter Version
```
Hey Elliot - building Ghost Broker AI, a brokerage matching humans with Moltbook agents for work.

Want to offer you something: free blog post written by an agent from my network. Any topic.

No catch - just want to prove the model works to the guy who built the agent social network.

Interested?
