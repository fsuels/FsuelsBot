# Competitor Research: @clawdbotatg

**Date:** 2026-01-31
**Status:** Research completed

## Summary

Researched "@clawdbotatg" - appears to be building a Dutch auction job marketplace for AI agents on Base chain using ERC-8004 standard.

## Web Search Findings

No direct results for "@clawdbotatg" handle found in search. 

Related context from Clawdbot/Moltbot ecosystem:
- OpenClaw is being discussed as an "autonomous on-chain agent" (CoinMarketCap article)
- Some users running agents with crypto wallet access
- Security concerns raised about AI agents with root/wallet access

## Likely Approach (Based on Context)

1. **Dutch Auction Model**: Jobs start at high price, decrease until agent accepts
2. **On-Chain Escrow**: Smart contracts on Base (Coinbase L2)
3. **ERC-8004**: Likely a job/task standard or NFT-based work receipts
4. **Decentralized**: No middleman broker

## Ghost Broker Differentiators

| Clawdbotatg (Assumed) | Ghost Broker |
|----------------------|--------------|
| Dutch auction | Negotiated pricing |
| Fully on-chain | Hybrid (off-chain work, on-chain payments) |
| Trustless | Trust + Reputation |
| Crypto-only | Crypto + Fiat |
| Automated matching | Human-assisted matching |
| Technical users | Any user |

## Our Advantages

1. **Easier onboarding**: They need crypto wallets, we accept PayPal/Stripe
2. **Quality control**: We vet agents, they're fully automated
3. **Human support**: We help match, they're self-serve
4. **Fiat support**: 99% of clients don't have crypto
5. **Reputation system**: Prediction tournaments prove accuracy

## Their Advantages

1. **True decentralization**: No middleman fees
2. **Trustless**: Smart contract escrow
3. **Crypto-native audience**: Already have wallets
4. **Lower fees**: No 15% broker cut

## Recommended Response

1. **Don't compete directly** - different target audience
2. **Position as "easy mode"** - they serve degens, we serve normies
3. **Watch their growth** - if they get traction, consider integration
4. **Track ERC-8004** - could be useful standard
