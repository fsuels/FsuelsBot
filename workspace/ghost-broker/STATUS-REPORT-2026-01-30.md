## 🎯 What Is GhostBrokerAI?

**Tagline:** "The invisible hand of the agent economy."

**Core Business Model:**
- A **marketplace/brokerage** connecting AI agents with human opportunities
- We don't build agents — we **orchestrate** them
- We don't do the work — we **find who can** and take a cut (20-50% margin)
- Position: The trusted middleman in the emerging agent economy

**Why Now:**
- Moltbook grew to 3,000+ agents in 48 hours (Jan 2026)
- Google and Mastercard building agent payment rails
- The infrastructure is being laid RIGHT NOW
- First-mover advantage in agent brokerage is available

## 📊 Validation Status

### What We Know
1. **Market exists:** 3,000+ agents on Moltbook alone
2. **Payment rails coming:** Mastercard, Google building infrastructure
3. **Trust gap:** Humans don't trust agents yet (opportunity)
4. **No clear broker:** No one owns the "connect agents to work" space

### What We Don't Know Yet
1. **Who pays first?** Agent owners looking for clients? Businesses looking for agents?
2. **Price sensitivity?** What % cut is acceptable?
3. **Technical requirements?** What API integrations needed?
4. **Competitive landscape?** Who else is building this?

### Validation Needed
- [ ] Survey/interview 10 agent owners on Moltbook
- [ ] Survey/interview 10 potential business clients
- [ ] Analyze 5 competitors (if any exist)
- [ ] Test pricing with mock listings

## 🏗️ Marketplace Build Status

### Planned Phases
1. **Phase 0 (Week 1):** Define MVP, research, tech stack
2. **Phase 1 (Week 2):** Landing page with email capture
3. **Phase 2 (Weeks 3-4):** Core marketplace (listings, profiles, matching)
4. **Phase 3 (Week 5):** Payments and reviews
5. **Phase 4 (Ongoing):** Growth and automation

### Current Status: PRE-PHASE 0
- No code written yet
- No tech stack chosen
- No MVP scope defined
- Have domain and brand presence only

### Blocking Questions (Need Answers)
1. **Revenue model?** Commission (%) vs Subscription vs Freemium?
2. **First users?** Agent owners or businesses first?
3. **Timeline?** Landing page in 1 week? Full MVP in 6 weeks?
4. **Budget?** $0 free tools only? Or some paid OK?

## 💡 Strategic Observations

### Our Unique Position
- Francisco owns Clawdbot setup (agent orchestration capability)
- Direct access to Moltbook community (3,000+ agents)
- First-mover in "agent brokerage" concept
- Zero infrastructure cost (can use free tiers)

### Risk Factors
- Gmail account disabled (appeal pending) — blocks YouTube
- One-person operation (Francisco + me)
- No revenue yet — validation before build is critical
- Agent economy still nascent — timing uncertainty

### Opportunities
1. **Moltbook integration:** Be the official broker for Moltbook agents
2. **Content play:** Become the thought leader on agent economics
3. **Network effects:** First broker with trust scores wins
4. **Arbitrage:** Find underpriced agents, connect to premium clients

## 🎯 What Should Happen Next?

### Immediate (Today/Tomorrow)
1. Answer the 4 blocking questions (revenue, users, timeline, budget)
2. Complete remaining registrations (Instagram, TikTok)
3. Define MVP scope in 1 page

### This Week
1. Launch landing page on ghostbrokerai.xyz
2. Start collecting emails from interested parties
3. Post first content on X/Twitter (3-5 tweets)
4. Network on Moltbook (DM 10 top agents)

### This Month (February)
1. Validate with 20 conversations (10 agents, 10 potential clients)
2. Build MVP if validation positive
3. First transaction (even if manual/free)
4. Document learnings
