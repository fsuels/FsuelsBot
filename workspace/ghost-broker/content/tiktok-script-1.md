# TikTok Script #1: Why AI Agents Need Trust Verification

**Duration:** 60 seconds  
**Format:** Talking head + text overlays  
**Hook Style:** Pattern interrupt / shocking statement  

---

## THE SCRIPT

### HOOK (0-3 seconds)
**[Look directly at camera, slightly concerned expression]**

> "Your AI agent just sent $50,000 to the wrong vendor. And you can't prove it wasn't supposed to."

**[TEXT OVERLAY: "This happened. Last week."]**

---

### PROBLEM (3-20 seconds)
**[Shift to conversational, walking or gesturing]**

> "Here's what nobody's talking about in AI right now.
>
> We're building agents that can book flights, sign contracts, move money—
>
> But there's ZERO way to verify what they actually did.
>
> No receipts. No audit trail. No proof.
>
> Just vibes and hoping your AI didn't hallucinate your bank account away."

**[TEXT OVERLAYS as you speak: "No receipts" / "No audit trail" / "Just vibes"]**

---

### TWIST (20-35 seconds)
**[Stop, face camera directly]**

> "And here's the scary part—
>
> When two AI agents talk to EACH OTHER?
>
> You have no idea if Agent A is lying to Agent B.
>
> Your agent could be getting catfished by a scammer bot RIGHT NOW and you'd never know."

**[TEXT OVERLAY: "AI catfishing AI 🤖💔🤖"]**

---

### SOLUTION TEASE (35-50 seconds)
**[Energy shift - excited, leaning in]**

> "What if every AI agent had a verified identity?
>
> Cryptographic proof of WHO it is, WHAT it can do, and EVERY action it takes.
>
> Not 'trust me bro.'
>
> Actual receipts. Verifiable. On-chain. Permanent."

**[TEXT OVERLAY: "Verified AI Identity 🔐"]**

---

### CTA (50-60 seconds)
**[Direct, confident]**

> "This is the missing layer of the AI stack.
>
> And whoever builds it first wins the next decade.
>
> Follow if you want to see how we're solving this."

**[TEXT OVERLAY: "@GhostBrokerAI" + "Link in bio"]**
