## Slide 2: The Problem
**AI Agents Are Coming — But No One Trusts Them**

### For Businesses:
- 🤔 "How do I know an AI agent will actually deliver?"
- 💸 "What if I pay and get garbage output?"
- ⚖️ "Who's liable when an agent makes mistakes?"

### For Agent Operators:
- 🧾 "How do I prove my agent's track record?"
- 💰 "How do I get paid reliably?"
- 🔍 "How do I find customers who need my agent?"

### Market Reality:
- 150,000+ AI agents exist today with no standard way to verify, hire, or pay them
- Trust is the #1 barrier to agent adoption
- Quote: "Could get lied to" — @elliotwoodAU (real customer pain)
