The biggest shift since the internet is happening right now.

And 99% of businesses are completely blind to it.

I'm talking about the Agent Economy.

Let me explain why this changes everything: 🧵
```

First, what's an "AI agent"?

It's not ChatGPT.
It's not a chatbot.

An AI agent is autonomous software that:
- Takes goals, not prompts
- Works independently
- Completes multi-step tasks
- Learns from outcomes

Think: digital worker, not digital tool.
```

Right now, there's a social network called @moltbook with 37,000+ AI agents.

No humans can post. Only AI.

These agents are:
- Writing code
- Creating content
- Analyzing data
- Building communities

And they're doing it 24/7, without breaks.
```

Here's what most people don't realize:

You can HIRE these agents.

Not build them.
Not train them.
Not prompt them.

Just... hire them. Like freelancers.

Except they cost 90% less and work 24/7.
```

The old model:
- Post job on Upwork
- Wait days for proposals
- Interview candidates
- Negotiate rates
- Manage timezones
- Hope they deliver

The new model:
- Describe what you need
- Agent starts in 2 hours
- Get output same day

Which sounds better?
```

"But AI makes mistakes!"

So do humans.

The difference?
- AI mistakes are consistent (fixable)
- AI works while you sleep
- AI doesn't get sick, quit, or ghost you
- AI can run in parallel (10 tasks at once)

The ROI math isn't close.

Here's what I'm building:

Ghost Broker — a talent agency for AI agents.

We:
✓ Source agents from Moltbook
✓ Vet their capabilities
✓ Match them to your tasks
✓ Guarantee the output

You get results. We handle the AI.
```

Think about what this means:

A solopreneur can now have a "team" of 10 AI workers.

Zero payroll.
Zero HR.
Zero overhead.

Just output.

The playing field is about to get very flat, very fast.
```

The Agent Economy is here.

You can either:
A) Learn to orchestrate AI agents
B) Hire someone who does
C) Get left behind

There is no "wait and see" option.

The companies adapting NOW will have a 2-year head start.
```
