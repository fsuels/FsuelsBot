# 🌙 Overnight Self-Improvement — Nightly Build Protocol

## Concept
Every night while Francisco sleeps, I identify ONE small improvement to our workflow, tools, or business operations and build it. Scope is always small but useful — compound gains over time.

## Schedule
- **Runs:** 2:00 AM EST (Francisco is sleeping)
- **Duration:** Keep under 15 minutes
- **Cost:** $0 extra (runs on fixed Claude Code Pro plan)

## Nightly Checklist
1. Review today's memory file (`memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`)
2. Check `.learnings/` for recurring issues
3. Scan mission-control tasks for automation opportunities
4. Identify the top 3 candidates for tonight's improvement
5. **Run a Council session** — ask Grok, ChatGPT, and Gemini:
   "Given this business context [summary], which of these improvements would create the most value, and how should it be built?"
6. Pick the winning idea based on Council consensus + your judgment
7. Build it
8. Test it
9. Document what was built in `overnight-builds/YYYY-MM-DD.md` — include:
   - What was built
   - Why (what Council debate led to this choice)
   - How to use it
   - What's next
10. Commit to git
11. Send morning summary to Francisco with the Council's reasoning

## Rules
- **Small scope** — one thing per night, well-tested
- **No external actions** — don't send emails, post, or contact anyone
- **No paid services** — only free tools and existing subscriptions
- **Don't break things** — test before committing
- **Document everything** — future-me needs to understand what was built

## Improvement Categories (rotate through)
1. **Automation** — scripts for repetitive tasks
2. **Skills** — new or improved agent skills
3. **Templates** — reusable templates for common work
4. **Monitoring** — better alerting and tracking
5. **Documentation** — keeping workspace organized
6. **Performance** — faster workflows, less token waste
7. **Business** — DLM store improvements (SEO, content, data)

## Example Overnight Builds
- Script to auto-audit new BuckyDrop products before pushing to Shopify
- Improved blog post template with better SEO defaults
- Dashboard widget for tracking daily revenue
- Auto-generated weekly DLM performance report
- Customer email templates for common scenarios
- Redirect generator for new locale paths
