- `message send` — Send drafts to Francisco for review via Telegram

## Brand Rules

1. **Voice**: Warm, genuine, family-focused — never salesy or pushy
2. **No fake urgency**: No "LAST CHANCE" or "ONLY 3 LEFT" unless true
3. **Image selection**: Pick best product photos, ensure no unswapped Chinese faces
4. **Reddit**: Value-first in r/mommit, r/parenting, r/toddlers — subtle product mentions only
