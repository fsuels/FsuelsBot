- **Spring (Mar-May)**: Consistently strong — families buying matching outfits for Easter, Mother's Day, spring photos
- **Holiday (Nov-Dec)**: Always spikes — Christmas matching pajamas/outfits are a huge seller
- **Summer (Jun-Aug)**: Mixed — swimsuits peak, but overall lower
- **Fall (Sep-Oct)**: Usually dips before holiday recovery
