## Free Shipping on All Orders

We offer **free standard shipping** to the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia, and Germany.

All orders are processed within **2–3 business days** after payment is confirmed. Orders placed on weekends or holidays are processed the next business day.

You'll receive a confirmation email with tracking information once your order ships.

### Estimated Delivery Times

Delivery times are estimates and begin **after your order has been shipped** (not from the date of purchase):

**Total time from order to delivery:** Processing (2-3 days) + Shipping (see above)

*Please note: Delivery times may vary during peak seasons (holidays, sales events) or due to customs processing for international orders.*

### Order Tracking

Every order includes a tracking number. Once your order ships, you'll receive an email with your tracking link. You can also visit our [How to Track](/pages/how-to-track) page for help.

### Customs & Import Duties

For international orders (outside the US), your package may be subject to customs duties and import taxes. These charges are determined by your country's customs office and are the responsibility of the recipient. We recommend checking with your local customs office for more information.
