# About Us — Dress Like Mommy (DRAFT)

## Our Story

### Where Family Fashion Meets Real Connection

Dress Like Mommy was born from a simple idea: families that match together, bond together.

Founded in 2016 by Francisco, a father of two girls in Naples, Florida, Dress Like Mommy started when he noticed how his daughters lit up every time they matched outfits with their mom. That spark of joy — the giggles, the photos, the "we're twinning!" moments — became the heart of a business dedicated to bringing families closer through fashion.

### What We Do

We curate matching outfits for moms, dads, and kids — from cozy holiday pajamas to everyday casual sets and special occasion looks. Every piece is selected with comfort, style, and affordability in mind, so families everywhere can create those picture-perfect moments without breaking the bank.

### Our Customers

Since 2016, we've served thousands of families across the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, and Australia. Whether it's Christmas morning matching jammies, a family photo shoot, or just a fun day out twinning with your mini-me, our customers keep coming back for the smiles these outfits create.

### Quality & Care

Every item in our collection goes through a careful selection process. We partner with trusted manufacturers to offer the latest family matching styles at fair prices. If something isn't right with your order, our customer service team is here to make it right.
