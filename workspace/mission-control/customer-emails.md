## 📧 EMAIL 1: Kathy Jurecek — Order #9428 ($402.84)
**URGENCY: 🔴 HIGHEST — $402 at risk, no Shopify Protect**
**To:** koj41611@aol.com
**Subject:** Your Dress Like Mommy Order #9428 — We Need to Confirm Your Shipping Address

---

Hi Kathy,

This is Francisco from Dress Like Mommy. I'm reaching out about your order #9428 placed on December 27th for your Family Matching Holiday Safari Animal Pajamas.

Before we ship, I noticed the name on the shipping address says "Kate Jurecek" while your account name is "Kathy." I wanted to double-check — should we ship to:

Kate Jurecek
4310 Pecan Bayou
Corpus Christi, TX 78410

Is that correct? Just reply "yes" and we'll get it shipped right away, or let me know if you'd like to update the address.

I apologize for the delay and want to get this to you as fast as possible.

Thanks,
Francisco

## 📧 EMAIL 2: Sally Cloud — Order #9392 ($154.92)
**URGENCY: 🔴 HIGH — 7 months old, chargeback risk**
**To:** princesspharaoh@gmail.com
**Subject:** Sincere Apology — Your Order #9392 from Dress Like Mommy

---

Hi Sally,

This is Francisco, the owner of Dress Like Mommy. I owe you an apology.

Your order #9392 from June 22nd for matching mother-daughter swimsuits has not been shipped, and that's completely unacceptable. I take full responsibility — no excuses.

I want to make this right. Here are your options:

1. **Full refund of $154.92** — processed immediately back to your Apple Pay
2. **Ship your order now** — if you'd still like the items, I'll get them out right away with expedited shipping at no extra cost

Since these were summer swimsuits and it's now January, I completely understand if you'd prefer the refund. Just reply with your preference and I'll take care of it the same day.

Again, I'm truly sorry for this experience. It doesn't reflect the standard I hold for my business.

Best regards,
Francisco Suels
Owner, Dress Like Mommy

## 📧 EMAIL 3: Lidson Charite — Order #9383 ($55.97)
**URGENCY: 🔴 HIGH — 9 months old, proactive refund recommended**
**To:** lidson.charite@gmail.com
**Subject:** Apology & Full Refund — Your Order #9383

---

Hi Lidson,

This is Francisco from Dress Like Mommy. I'm writing about your order #9383 from April 27th for the Mommy and Me Matching Floral Print Jumpsuits.

I have to be upfront — your order was never shipped, and I'm deeply sorry. There's no excuse for a 9-month delay.

Since the baby size you ordered (3-6 months) wouldn't fit anymore, I'm processing a **full refund of $55.97** back to your original payment method. You should see it within 5-10 business days.

As a small token of apology, here's a 25% discount code for any future order: **SORRYLIDSON25**

I hope you'll give us another chance, but I completely understand if not. Either way, I wanted to own this mistake and make it right.

Sincerely,
Francisco Suels
Owner, Dress Like Mommy

## 📧 EMAIL 4: Amanda Keesee — Order #9388 (partial, $15.99 remaining)
**URGENCY: 🟡 MEDIUM — 1 missing item, 8 months**
**To:** amandalkeesee@gmail.com
**Subject:** Missing Item from Your Order #9388 — Refund Processed

---

Hi Amanda,

This is Francisco from Dress Like Mommy. I hope you received and enjoyed the 3 items from your order #9388 that shipped back in June!

I'm writing because 1 item from your order — the Daddy & Baby Matching "Babysaurus" T-Shirt Set (Child 1 Year, Black, $15.99) — was unfortunately out of stock and never shipped. I should have notified you much sooner, and I apologize.

Since the size (1 year) likely wouldn't fit anymore, I've processed a **partial refund of $15.99** back to your Apple Pay. You should see it within 5-10 business days.

If you're interested in a different size or similar item, I'd love to offer you 20% off your next order: **AMANDA20**

Thanks for your patience, and again, I'm sorry for the oversight.

Best,
Francisco Suels
Owner, Dress Like Mommy

Hi Peggy,

I want to make this right immediately. Could you please share your order number or the email you used when ordering? Once I have that, I'll either:

1. Get your order shipped out right away with tracking
2. Process a full refund — whichever you prefer

Again, I sincerely apologize for the delay. I'll be monitoring this closely and will respond right away.

Thanks,
