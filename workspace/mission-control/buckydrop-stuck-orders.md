### Total Exposure
- **Total BuckyDrop cost**: ~CN ¥2,228 (~$306 USD)
- **Customer-facing revenue at risk**: Much higher (retail markup)
- **Oldest unfulfilled order**: 13+ months (#9290, Dec 2024)

### Recommended Actions

1. **Immediate**: Decide on each order — fulfill, refund, or cancel
2. **"Purchasing Pending" orders**: Contact BuckyDrop about why these were never purchased
3. **"Purchased" orders**: These items may be sitting in BuckyDrop warehouse — check if they can still be shipped
4. **"Short Delivered"**: File claims with suppliers for defective items
5. **Customer communication**: Reach out to all 10 customers (emails drafted for some already in customer-emails.md)
6. **"User Requirement" orders**: Respond to BuckyDrop's requests so these can proceed

### Decision Framework (For Each Order)

Before contacting customers, CHECK IN SHOPIFY FIRST:
1. **Is the order still open/unfulfilled?** If already refunded or chargebacked, no email needed
2. **Did the customer contact you already?** Check order notes and email threads
3. **Can BuckyDrop still fulfill it?** Items in "Purchased" status might still be in warehouse

| Order | Age | Recommended Action |
|-------|-----|-------------------|
| #9409 Tejas Shah | 3 mo | Contact BuckyDrop re: defects. If items can be replaced, fulfill. If not, refund. |
| #9392 Ariel Cloud | 7 mo | EMAIL ALREADY DRAFTED. Likely needs full refund + discount code. |
| #9383 Lidson Charite | 9 mo | EMAIL ALREADY DRAFTED. Full refund recommended. |
| #9378 Lindsey Fine | 9 mo | Respond to BuckyDrop "User Requirement" first, then decide. |
| #9365 Madhu R (UK) | 10 mo | Check if items still in BuckyDrop warehouse. If yes, ship. If no, refund. |
| #9362 Lawrence McCann (UK) | 10 mo | Likely chargeback already. Check Shopify. Full refund if not. |
| #9355 Kirk Boland | 10 mo | Same supplier as #9351 — check BuckyDrop warehouse for both. |
| #9351 Rhonda Hughes | 11 mo | Same as above — batch check with #9355. |
| #9334 Brynne McSweeny | 12 mo | Respond to "User Requirement" in BuckyDrop, then full refund likely. |
| #9290 Stephen Ravotta | 13 mo | Oldest order. Almost certainly chargebacked. Check Shopify status. |

**Priority order:** Start with #9409 (newest, most salvageable), then work backward.

### ⚠️ Additional Alert: BuckyDrop App Reauthorization Needed
BuckyDrop shows a warning: "Due to a recent Shopify update, publications of products on sales channels have changed. Please promptly reauthorize the BuckyDrop App."
- This may affect ability to push new products or sync orders
- Action: Go to Shopify App Store and reauthorize BuckyDrop

### 71 Unpushed Products Assessment
The 71 products not pushed to Shopify are mostly women's dresses/evening wear that do NOT fit the mommy-and-me niche:
- Christmas pajamas (seasonal, expired)
- Evening/banquet dresses
- Wedding dresses
- Generic women's summer dresses
- Some with Chinese-translated titles

**Recommendation**: Do NOT bulk-push these. Instead, source new mommy-and-me products specifically for spring/summer 2026 season.
