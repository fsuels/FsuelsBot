Easter is one of those holidays that practically calls for a matching outfit. Between brunch, church, egg hunts, and the annual family photo on the front porch, you and your mini-me deserve to look like spring just walked in the door.

Whether you go full matching twin mode or prefer complementary coordinates, here are the best mommy and me Easter dress ideas for 2026.

## Why Easter Is the Best Holiday for Matching

Valentine's Day gets the red dresses. Christmas owns plaid pajamas. But Easter? Easter belongs to pastels, florals, and that gorgeous golden-hour light that makes every family photo look like a magazine cover.

It's also the first warm-weather holiday of the year — which means sundresses, open-toe shoes, and outfits that feel as good as they look. No bulky layers, no winter coats in the background of your photos. Just spring in full bloom.

## Top Mommy and Me Easter Dress Styles

### 1. Matching Floral Dresses

Nothing says Easter like florals. A matching floral dress in soft pinks, lavenders, or yellows is the classic choice for a reason — it photographs beautifully and works for everything from church to the egg hunt. [Shop our dresses collection →](/collections/dresses)

### 2. Pastel Sundresses

Simple, elegant, timeless. Matching pastel sundresses in lilac, mint, baby blue, or blush are universally flattering and let the matching moment speak for itself. Less is more when the colors are this pretty.

### 3. Lace or Eyelet Details

For a more polished Easter look, matching dresses with lace trim or eyelet fabric add a touch of elegance. These work especially well for church or a sit-down Easter brunch.

### 4. Maxi Dresses for Mom, Mini for Daughter

One of the most adorable matching looks is mom in a flowing maxi dress and daughter in the same print as a shorter dress or romper. Same pattern, different silhouettes — it looks intentional and stylish. [Browse maxi dresses →](/collections/maxi-dresses)

### 5. Matching Sets (Top + Skirt)

If dresses aren't your thing, a matching skirt-and-top set gives you the coordinated look with more versatility. Mix and match pieces later for everyday wear.

## Easter Color Guide

The right colors make all the difference for Easter:

- **Soft Pink** — The quintessential Easter color. Flattering on every skin tone.
- **Lavender** — Modern and fresh. Stands out in photos without being loud.
- **Mint Green** — Perfect for outdoor settings with lots of greenery.
- **Baby Blue** — Classic and calming. Pairs beautifully with white accessories.
- **Buttercup Yellow** — Bold but springy. Great if you want to make a statement.
- **Coral** — A warmer option that bridges winter and spring.

**Pro tip:** Avoid bright white for Easter dresses if you'll be outdoors — it can wash out in photos. Instead, go for ivory or cream as your neutral base.

## Complete the Easter Look

The dress is the star, but the details bring it together:

**For Mom:**
- Nude or pastel heels (or wedges for grass-friendly events)
- Minimal gold jewelry
- A straw clutch or crossbody
- Soft, natural makeup with a pink lip

**For Mini-Me:**
- Matching headband or hair bow (we carry [matching accessories →](/collections/accessories))
- White or pastel Mary Janes
- A little basket for the egg hunt
- A cardigan for early-morning church

## When to Order Your Easter Outfits

Easter 2026 is **April 20**. Here's your timeline:

- **February:** Start browsing. The best matching sets sell out early.
- **March:** Order by mid-March to allow 2-3 weeks for delivery.

## Include the Whole Family

Easter matching doesn't have to stop at mommy and me:

- **Daddy and daughter** in complementary colors (dad in a polo that matches her dress color)
