# DLM Blog Content Strategy
*Created: 2026-01-27 | Target: Free organic traffic via SEO blog content*

## Why This Matters
- Blog is EMPTY (1 default Shopify post from 2016)
- All competitors (Sparkle In Pink, PatPat, Ivy City Co, Posh Peanut) have active blogs
- Blog posts target long-tail keywords that product pages can't rank for
- Each post drives traffic AND links to products = free sales funnel
