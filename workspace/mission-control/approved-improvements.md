## 🧠 THE COUNCIL — Research Improvement Evaluation

### 📋 QUESTION
Evaluate 3 proposed improvements from today's research for DLM's AI assistant workspace. Budget is tight — NO extra costs allowed without approval.

### 🤖 PANEL RESPONSES

**🟢 CHATGPT 5.2 says:**
- Branding update: YES, P1 — cheap, fast, removes confusion
- ElevenLabs TTS: NO — speculative ROI, violates budget constraint  
- Docs audit: YES, P2 — potential direct efficiency gains, but time-box it

**🤖 GROK says:**
- *(Query truncated — received generic AI improvement suggestions instead of evaluating our specific proposals. Discarded from synthesis.)*

**💎 GEMINI says:**
- *(Rate limited — 429 error: "No capacity available for model gemini-2.5-pro")*

### ✅ CONSENSUS (ChatGPT + Claude analysis)
1. **Branding update is low-hanging fruit** — 30 min, zero cost, removes friction
2. **TTS skill violates budget constraint** — requires paid API, no clear business ROI
3. **Docs audit has potential** — but needs ruthless ROI filtering to avoid rabbit holes

### ⚔️ KEY INSIGHT
The ElevenLabs TTS skill is a **luxury feature** with no proven revenue connection. Voice/TTS only makes sense if you're auto-generating voiceovers for ads at scale — DLM isn't there yet.

## 🏆 FINAL VERDICTS

### 1. Update Branding: Clawdbot → Moltbot
| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Status** | ✅ APPROVED |
| **Priority** | **P1 — Do tonight** |
| **Effort** | 30 min |
| **Cost** | $0 |

**Reasoning:** Hygiene work that removes real confusion. Clear, consistent naming improves internal velocity. The rebrand already happened — workspace should reflect reality.

**Modification:** Use global search (Ctrl+Shift+F in VS Code) + checklist to ensure no missed references.

### 2. Install ElevenLabs TTS Skill
| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Status** | ❌ REJECTED |
| **Priority** | **P3 — Parked indefinitely** |
| **Effort** | 30 min (but ongoing API costs) |
| **Cost** | Requires paid API key |

**Reasoning:** Violates the zero-extra-cost constraint. TTS has speculative ROI for dropshipping — the workflow is text-native (product research, copy, supplier comms). No proven uplift from voice features.

**Revisit Condition:** Only if Francisco explicitly approves AND there's a clear revenue-linked use case (e.g., "TTS reduces X hours/week of paid work" or "voiceover ads have proven CTR uplift").

### 3. Audit Against New Moltbot Documentation
| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Status** | ✅ APPROVED (with modification) |
| **Priority** | **P2 — This week** |
| **Effort** | 2 hours MAX (time-boxed) |
| **Cost** | $0 |

**Reasoning:** This is the only item with potential direct efficiency gains — discovering missed automations, better prompting patterns, or new features that reduce manual ops.

**CRITICAL MODIFICATION:** Audit with **checklist mindset**, not exploratory reading:
- Filter: "Does this reduce time, errors, or cost in current DLM workflows?"
- Skip anything requiring paid add-ons or major refactors
- Produce a short list of: "Adopt now" / "Ignore" / "Revisit if scale increases"
- Hard cap at 2 hours — rabbit hole risk is real
