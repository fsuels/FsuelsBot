## Growth Tactics
1. **Respond to every comment within 1 hour** (algorithm boost)
2. **Engage with 10 similar accounts daily** (comment on their posts)
3. **Use Instagram Reels** — matching outfit reveal videos get 2-5x reach
4. **Collab with micro-influencers** — offer free matching set for photo + tag
5. **Run monthly giveaway** — "Follow + tag a mom friend to win matching set"

## Metrics to Track
- Follower growth (currently 849)
- Engagement rate (likes + comments / followers)
- Link clicks to shop
- Story poll participation
- DM conversations (4 unanswered = lost sales!)
