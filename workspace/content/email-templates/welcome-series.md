Hey [First Name],

You know that moment when your daughter sees you getting dressed and says, "I want to match!"?

That's exactly how Dress Like Mommy was born.

We're a small, family-run shop that believes matching outfits aren't just clothes — they're connection. When a mom and daughter (or dad and son!) show up twinning, something magical happens. The giggles. The photos. The memories that last forever.

We search the world for the cutest matching sets so you don't have to. Every piece is chosen with real families in mind — comfortable enough for playground adventures, stylish enough for family photos.

**Our promise:** Quality matching outfits at prices that won't break the bank.
