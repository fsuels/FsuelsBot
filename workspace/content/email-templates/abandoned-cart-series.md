## Implementation Notes

**Platform:** Shopify Email (built-in) or Klaviyo
**Trigger:** Cart abandoned (items added but checkout not completed)
**Timing:** 1 hour, 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours
**Exclusions:** Don't send to customers who completed purchase after Email 1
**Discount code:** COMEBACK10 (10% off, single use, 48hr expiry, auto-generated per customer if using Klaviyo)
**Expected recovery rate:** 5-15% of abandoned carts

**Priority:** This is the #1 highest-ROI email automation. Set this up FIRST before welcome series.
**Revenue estimate:** DLM gets ~5 orders/month. If 3x that abandon carts, recovering even 2-3 per month = $200-400/month additional revenue.
