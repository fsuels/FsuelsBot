# Overnight Build — January 28, 2026

## What Was Built

### 1. Live Activity Monitor (⚡ Activity tab)
**Problem:** Francisco had no way to see what I'm doing without asking in Telegram.
**Solution:** Python backend tails Clawdbot logs, parses events into human-readable activity feed. Dashboard shows real-time status with pulsing orb, tool calls, errors, and model info.
**Files:** `mission-control/activity-server.py`, updated `index.html`

### 2. High-Level Task Display  
**Problem:** Activity feed showed "Using browser" instead of which task was being worked on.
**Solution:** `current-task.json` file written by Clawd when starting a task. Dashboard reads it and displays task ID, project, title, and progress.
**Files:** `mission-control/current-task.json`

### 3. Multi-Project Support
**Problem:** Everything was lumped together — DLM business and Agent System tasks.
**Solution:** Added `project` field to all tasks. Three filter buttons: All Projects, Dress Like Mommy (42 tasks), Agent System (9 tasks). Purple badge on Agent tasks.
**Files:** Updated `data.json`, `index.html`

### 4. Gateway Status Fix (Offline → Connected)
**Problem:** Dashboard showed "⚠️ Offline" even when Clawdbot was running. Phone couldn't reach loopback gateway.
**Solution:** Activity server proxies `/api/status` from gateway (127.0.0.1:18789) to LAN clients.
**Files:** `activity-server.py`

### 5. Gateway Crash Prevention
**Problem:** `TypeError: fetch failed` unhandled promise rejection crashed the gateway repeatedly.
**Solutions applied:**
- Installed gateway as Windows Scheduled Task (auto-restart on crash)
- Added `--unhandled-rejections=warn` flag to gateway.cmd (pending restart)
- Created watchdog script as backup (`scripts/clawdbot-watchdog.ps1`)

### 6. Mission Control Full Update (30 completed tasks)
**Problem:** data.json was stale (last updated 12:55 PM).
**Solution:** Added all 30 completed tasks from Jan 27, updated in-progress items, added new Second Brain entries.

## Impact
- Francisco can now monitor AI activity from his phone in real-time
- Dashboard tracks separate projects independently
- Gateway is more stable (auto-restart + crash prevention)
- Complete record of all Jan 27 accomplishments

## Git Commits
- `Mission Control: massive update with all Jan 27 work`
- `Add live Activity Monitor to Mission Control`
- `Activity Monitor v2 — human-readable messages`
- `Fix offline indicator — proxy gateway status`
- `Activity Monitor v3 — high-level task display`
- `Multi-project support — filter by DLM / Agent System`
- `Add crash error log + watchdog script`

## What's Next (Morning Priorities)
1. Francisco needs to restart gateway (`clawdbot gateway restart`) for crash fix
2. Order #9432 Shopify Protect expires today — tracking upload critical
3. Check BuckyDrop support response (8 AM cron)
4. 9 AM AI Research Brief (cron)
5. Continue locale redirects (MC-029)
