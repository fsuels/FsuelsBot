# INC-20260128-002: Lost Context After Compaction

**Date:** 2026-01-28
**Severity:** P0
**Status:** resolved

## What Happened
After context compaction, I saw "Summary unavailable" and didn't know what we were working on. Failed to read active-thread.md which had the answer.

## Root Cause
1. Relied on compaction summary instead of file-based recovery
2. active-thread.md existed but I didn't automatically read it
3. No enforcement mechanism — just a rule I could forget

## Impact
- Lost track of current work (Valentine's Day DLM prep)
- Francisco had to remind me what we were doing
- Broke trust in my reliability

## Resolution
1. **Tier 1:** Added CURRENT STATE section to AGENTS.md (always injected)
2. **Tier 2:** Created state.json as authoritative source + events.jsonl audit trail
3. **Council consulted:** Both AIs agreed on "make forgetting non-fatal" approach
4. **CONSTITUTION.md:** Created with inviolable rules

## Prevention
- [x] New rule added to CONSTITUTION.md — "Memory decisions require Council approval"
- [x] Procedure updated in AGENTS.md — Context Truncation Recovery protocol
- [x] State management system created — state.json + events.jsonl
- [x] Standing rule — All memory architecture changes require Council review

## Lessons Learned
1. **Make forgetting non-fatal** — Don't try to remember everything; make it so forgetting can't cause harm
2. **State in system prompt** — Critical state must be auto-injected, not require me to read files
3. **Redundancy** — Multiple layers (state.json, events.jsonl, AGENTS.md render)
4. **Council review** — Memory is too important for unilateral decisions
