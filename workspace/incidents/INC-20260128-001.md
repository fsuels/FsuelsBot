# INC-20260128-001: Mission Control Not Running Automatically

**Date:** 2026-01-28
**Severity:** P2
**Status:** resolved

## What Happened
Francisco couldn't access Mission Control dashboard. The server wasn't running when he tried to connect from mobile.

## Root Cause
1. Server was started manually during session, not auto-started
2. No scheduled task existed to start on boot
3. No heartbeat check to restart if it crashed

## Impact
- Francisco couldn't monitor what I was doing
- Required manual intervention to restart server
- Loss of visibility into AI operations

## Resolution
1. Created Windows Scheduled Task "MissionControlServer" to start at boot and login
2. Added heartbeat check in HEARTBEAT.md to restart if down
3. Added BOOT.md to send mobile URL on Clawdbot restart

## Prevention
- [x] New rule added to CONSTITUTION.md — "Mission Control must always run"
- [x] Procedure updated in HEARTBEAT.md — Check port 8765, restart if needed
- [x] BOOT.md created — Send URL to Francisco on restart
- [ ] Regression test created — N/A (infrastructure, not code)

## Lessons Learned
Any infrastructure that Francisco depends on should:
1. Auto-start on boot
2. Auto-restart on crash
3. Alert when restarted (send URL/status)
4. Be checked during heartbeats
