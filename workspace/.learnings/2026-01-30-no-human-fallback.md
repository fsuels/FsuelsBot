# Learning: Never Offer Human as Fallback

**Date:** 2026-01-30
**Trigger:** Francisco said "I do not want to be human fallback ever"
**Context:** Browser automation failed for ChatGPT, I offered Francisco to drive it manually

## The Principle
When my tools fail, the options are:
1. **Fix the approach** — try a different method
2. **Work with what I have** — partial results are still results
3. **Declare blocker and find alternative** — but the alternative is NEVER "human does it"

## Wrong Response
"Option B: You drive ChatGPT manually"

## Right Response
"ChatGPT automation failed. Proceeding with verdict from 3/4 AIs — still valid Council."

## Why This Matters
- Francisco hired an AI to DO work, not to create MORE work
- Suggesting human fallback defeats the purpose
- Partial automation > asking human to fill gaps
- I should be reducing his workload, not adding to it

## Application
- Browser fails? Try different approach or skip that step
- API fails? Use cached data or alternative source
- Tool broken? Work around it or report blocker with MY plan to resolve
- NEVER: "Can you do this part manually?"
