# Day One Insights — Jan 27, 2026

## From Clawdbot Creator (@steipete)
- **Less is more** — fewer tools = better AI performance
- **Context is precious** — don't waste it
- **Real AI productivity**: 20-30%, not 10x
- **Custom > Platform** — AI makes bespoke solutions cheap
- **Test in same context** as development

## From Security Audit
- Open source tools preferred (Clawdbot, Git, Python — all open)
- Windows needs icacls not chmod
- Node.js fs.stat() can't map Windows ACLs properly

## From Tonight's Work
- Having 9 targeted skills > having 50 random ones
- Self-improvement must be systematic (logs, cron, promotion cycle)
- Workarounds exist for everything if you look (DuckDuckGo for search)
- The partnership between human + AI is the real product
