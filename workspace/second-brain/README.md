# 🧠 Second Brain

*Your knowledge base for ideas, research, and opportunities.*

## Structure

### 📂 ideas/
Raw ideas — anything that comes to mind. Business, product, marketing, tech. Capture first, filter later.

### 📂 research/
Deep dives on topics. Competitor analysis, market research, technology evaluations.

### 📂 opportunities/
Actionable opportunities discovered through research, browsing, or conversation.

### 📂 resources/
Bookmarks, articles, tools, references worth keeping.

### 📂 insights/
Distilled wisdom from research. Patterns, lessons, frameworks worth remembering.

## How It Works
- **Capture:** Throw anything in `ideas/` with a date prefix
- **Research:** When an idea has potential, research it and put findings in `research/`
- **Evaluate:** Promising research becomes an `opportunity/` with action steps
- **Learn:** Key takeaways go into `insights/` for future reference
- **Archive:** Stale ideas get moved to `ideas/archive/`

## Quick Add
Tell me: "brain: [your idea]" and I'll capture it immediately.
