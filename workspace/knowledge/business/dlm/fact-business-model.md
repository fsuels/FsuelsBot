# Dress Like Mommy Business Model

## Core Facts

**Business:** Dress Like Mommy (dresslikemommy.com)
**Entity:** FKG Trading LLC
**Model:** Dropshipping — no inventory held

## How It Works

1. Customer orders on Shopify store
2. Order forwarded to BuckyDrop
3. BuckyDrop sources from 1688/Taobao suppliers
4. Ships direct to customer from China

## Key Metrics

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Peak Revenue | ~$100K/year | During pandemic |
| 3-Year Total (2023-2026) | $46,399 | Shopify |
| Current Status | Rebuilding | Post-crypto focus |

## Markets Served

- USA (primary)
- UK
- Canada
- Australia

## Pricing Rule

**Cost × 1.5 = Minimum Price** (50% margin minimum)

All pricing uses USA YunExpress shipping as baseline.

## Why Sales Dropped

Francisco lost focus — got pulled into crypto. Site neglected. Now rebuilding with AI assistance.
