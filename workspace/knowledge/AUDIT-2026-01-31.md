## DETAILED FINDINGS

### 1. x-link-analysis.md

**SOUND LOGIC:** ✅ PASS
- Clear step-by-step workflow
- Evaluation questions are logical
- Audit trail requirement is solid

**VERIFIED EVIDENCE:** ✅ PASS
- Requires full post text capture
- Requires engagement numbers
- Requires author credentials
- Evidence links mandatory

**NO FALLACIES:** ❌ FAIL
- **MISSING:** No explicit fallacy detection step
- **PROBLEM:** Could accept viral post claims without checking for logical fallacies
- **EXAMPLE:** A post saying "Everyone is doing X" (bandwagon fallacy) would pass unchallenged

**FIX REQUIRED:**
Add to Step 4 (Evaluate):
```
### Fallacy Check (MANDATORY)
Before accepting ANY claim from the post, verify:
- [ ] Not Ad Hominem (attacks person, not argument)
- [ ] Not Bandwagon (popularity ≠ truth)
- [ ] Not False Cause (correlation ≠ causation)
- [ ] Not Appeal to Authority (credentials ≠ correctness)
- [ ] Evidence provided (not just claims)
```

---

### 2. pricing.md

**SOUND LOGIC:** ✅ PASS
- Mathematical formula is clear
- 50% margin rule is logical
- Competitor check adds validation

**VERIFIED EVIDENCE:** ✅ PASS
- Requires actual cost data from BuckyDrop
- Requires competitor price verification
- Evidence captured in pricing gate

**NO FALLACIES:** ❌ FAIL
- **MISSING:** No check for pricing fallacies
- **PROBLEM:** Could fall for "competitors charge this so we should" (bandwagon)
- **PROBLEM:** Could assume "higher price = higher quality perception" without evidence

**FIX REQUIRED:**
Add to Competitor Check section:
```
### Pricing Logic Check
Before setting final price, verify:
- [ ] Not following competitors blindly (they may be wrong)
- [ ] Price justified by OUR costs, not just market
- [ ] "Perceived value" claims backed by evidence
- [ ] Not assuming correlation (high price = high sales)
```

---

### 3. product-listing.md

**SOUND LOGIC:** ✅ PASS
- 8-gate pipeline is logically structured
- Hard dependencies prevent skipping steps
- Ledger tracking ensures state management

**VERIFIED EVIDENCE:** ✅ PASS
- Evidence links required at each gate
- Checkpoint protocol captures state
- No gate completion without artifacts

**NO FALLACIES:** ❌ FAIL
- **MISSING:** No explicit fallacy check in vendor selection
- **PROBLEM:** Could pick vendor because "many others use them" (bandwagon)
- **PROBLEM:** Could trust "factory direct" label without verification

**FIX REQUIRED:**
Add to Gate 1 (Discovery/Vet):
```
### Vendor Logic Check
- [ ] Rating is ACTUAL (not from fake reviews)
- [ ] "Factory direct" VERIFIED (not just claimed)
- [ ] Sales volume is REAL (cross-check multiple indicators)
- [ ] Not selecting because "others use this vendor"
```

---

### 4. vendor-vetting.md

**SOUND LOGIC:** ✅ PASS
- 5-point check is systematic
- Scoring system is clear
- Red flags are explicit

**VERIFIED EVIDENCE:** ⚠️ PARTIAL
- Relies on 1688 data which could be fake
- No cross-verification step
- No external evidence sources

**NO FALLACIES:** ❌ FAIL
- **MISSING:** Explicit fallacy detection
- **PROBLEM:** High rating could be from fake reviews (false evidence)
- **PROBLEM:** "Verified badge" trusted without checking what it means

**FIX REQUIRED:**
Add verification layer:
```
### Evidence Verification
- [ ] Check reviews for patterns (copy-paste = fake)
- [ ] Cross-check sales with review count (mismatch = suspicious)
- [ ] Badges verified against official criteria
- [ ] At least 2 independent indicators agree
```

---

### 5. browser.md

**SOUND LOGIC:** ✅ PASS
- Rules are clear and actionable
- Pre-flight checklist is logical
- Fallback rule added (T198)

**VERIFIED EVIDENCE:** ⚠️ PARTIAL
- No evidence capture requirement
- No screenshot mandate for verification

**NO FALLACIES:** ❌ FAIL
- **MISSING:** No motto at top
- **MISSING:** No logic check for browser actions

**FIX REQUIRED:**
Add at top of file:
```

### 6. Council SKILL.md

**SOUND LOGIC:** ✅ PASS
- Disagreement-first protocol ensures diverse views
- Cross-examination breaks weak arguments
- Synthesis rules prevent averaging

**VERIFIED EVIDENCE:** ✅ PASS

## PATTERNS DISCOVERED

1. **All procedures have good LOGIC** — we structure workflows well
2. **Most procedures have good EVIDENCE** — we track artifacts
3. **NO procedure had FALLACY CHECKS** — this is the gap
4. **The motto was not embedded** — now it will be
