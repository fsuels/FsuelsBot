## Usage Notes

- **Emotional hooks that work:** "she's only this little once," "the photo you'll frame," "memories over things"
- **Urgency drivers:** Feb 10 deadline, low stock alerts, limited edition framing
- **Visual pairing suggestions:** Pink/red/heart themes, lifestyle photos of real moms + daughters, soft lighting, candid moments over posed shots
- **Avoid:** Generic "shop now" without emotional context, stock photo vibes, anything that feels like it could be any kids' clothing store
