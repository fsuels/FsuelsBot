## Competitive Positioning Opportunities

### Where DLM Can Win:

1. **Urgency + Free Shipping**
   - "Order by Feb 10 for Valentine's delivery"
   - Most competitors don't show shipping deadlines prominently

2. **Family Matching (not just Mommy+Me)**
   - Include daddy, siblings, whole family sets
   - Competitors focus heavily on mom+daughter only

3. **Quality Photography**
   - Real family photos, lifestyle shots
   - Many competitors use generic product shots

4. **Hearts + Red = Non-Negotiable**
   - Every competitor has heart patterns
   - Red/pink must dominate Valentine's collection

5. **Emotional Copy**
   - "Match her love" (our current copy) is good
   - Could add "Create memories together"
