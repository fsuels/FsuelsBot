# Principle: Budget Rules
*Priority: P0*
*Established: 2026-01-27*
*Source: Francisco directive via Telegram*

## Rule
**$0 extra spending allowed.** All AI services must use existing flat-rate subscriptions. Never add any paid service, API key, or subscription without Francisco's explicit approval.

## Current Subscriptions (Fixed Cost)
- Claude Max â€” $100/month flat (Opus 4.5 + Sonnet unlimited)
- X/Grok â€” included in X subscription
- ChatGPT Pro â€” flat subscription
- Open Arena â€” free
- Gemini CLI â€” free (Google OAuth)

## Rationale
Francisco lost ~$150K in crypto and is cash-constrained. Every dollar counts. The system must generate revenue, not consume it. The existing subscriptions provide unlimited AI access at zero marginal cost.

## Exceptions
- Only Francisco can authorize new spending
- Must be explicitly approved (not implied)
- Even free trials that convert to paid are not allowed without approval
