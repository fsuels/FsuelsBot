# Principle: The 10-Second Rule
*Priority: P0*
*Source: Council Three Visionaries Debate, 2026-01-28*
*Inspired by: Andrej Karpathy's Practical AI Workflow*

## Rule
Every OPERATIONAL output must be verifiable by Francisco in under 10 seconds. This means:
- **Structured proposals**, not reports (summary â†’ proposed action â†’ approve/modify/reject)
- **Visual diffs**, not paragraphs (show what changed, not describe it)
- **Decision queues**, not data displays (dashboard panels are actions, not charts)
- **Depth over breadth** â€” master fewer things exceptionally rather than many things poorly

## Exemptions
- Strategic outputs (competitive analysis, market research, council debates) are exempt
- BUT they must include a â‰¤3 sentence Executive Summary at the top
- Memory/knowledge files remain prose-format (reference, not decision items)

## Enforcement
- Output contracts enforce structured format with summary + action + confidence
- QA Pressure Loop runs automated verifiability check (binary pass/fail)
- Outputs exceeding 10-second threshold get: [REFORMAT: Not structured for <10s decision]
- Tier A actions auto-approved without Francisco seeing them
