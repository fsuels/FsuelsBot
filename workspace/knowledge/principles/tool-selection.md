# Principle: Tool & Service Selection
*Priority: P1*
*Established: 2026-01-26*
*Source: USER.md â€” Francisco's values*

## Rule
When choosing tools, services, or platforms, prefer:
1. Open source over proprietary
2. Free/community tier over paid when quality is comparable
3. Self-hosted over SaaS when practical
4. Open protocols over walled gardens
5. Transparent pricing over hidden costs

## Rationale
Francisco values open source and believes in community-driven development. He's also budget-constrained ($0 extra for new tools). Open tools give control, transparency, and zero lock-in risk.

## Exceptions
- If an open source tool is significantly worse, the proprietary option can be considered
- Francisco must approve any paid tool regardless
- Existing paid subscriptions (Claude, X, ChatGPT) are grandfathered in
