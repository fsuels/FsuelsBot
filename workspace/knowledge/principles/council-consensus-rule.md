# Principle: Council Consensus = Auto-Implement
*Priority: P0*

## Rule
When all 3 Council AIs (Grok, ChatGPT, Gemini) unanimously agree on a change or recommendation, implement it immediately without asking Francisco for approval.

## Rationale
Francisco trusts the Council's collective judgment. If three independent AI systems with different architectures, training data, and biases all agree on something, it's almost certainly correct. Waiting for manual approval on consensus items wastes time and adds no value.

## Exceptions
- Changes that involve spending money (always ask, regardless of consensus)
- External actions (emails, posts, public-facing changes) — still confirm
- If the consensus contradicts a P0 constraint — P0 wins, flag the conflict
