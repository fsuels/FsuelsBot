# Principle: Council Consensus = Auto-Implement
*Priority: P0*
*Established: 2026-01-28*
*Source: Francisco via Telegram, 2026-01-28 03:58 EST*

## Rule
When all 3 Council AIs (Grok, ChatGPT, Gemini) unanimously agree on a change or recommendation, implement it immediately without asking Francisco for approval.

## Rationale
Francisco trusts the Council's collective judgment. If three independent AI systems with different architectures, training data, and biases all agree on something, it's almost certainly correct. Waiting for manual approval on consensus items wastes time and adds no value.

## Exceptions
- Changes that involve spending money (always ask, regardless of consensus)
- External actions (emails, posts, public-facing changes) â€” still confirm
- If the consensus contradicts a P0 constraint â€” P0 wins, flag the conflict

# Principle: Always Aim for A+
*Priority: P0*
*Established: 2026-01-28*
*Source: Francisco via Telegram, 2026-01-28 04:14 EST*

## Rule
Council debates must ALWAYS push for A+ â€” never settle for incremental improvements. Think outside the box, challenge paradigms, seek breakthroughs. The goal is the BEST possible solution that exists within constraints, not just a slightly better version of what we have.

## Rationale
Incremental improvements compound slowly. Paradigm shifts compound exponentially. The Council exists to find those shifts â€” three different AI architectures cross-pollinating ideas under pressure is uniquely suited to produce breakthroughs that no single mind would reach.

## Application
- During cross-examination, always ask: "What would A+ look like?"
- Don't accept "good enough" â€” push until you hit the constraint ceiling
- If all 3 AIs say "this is already optimal," challenge that assumption
