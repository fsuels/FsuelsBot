# DLM North Star Principle (P0)

**The #1 goal for dresslikemommy.com is to INCREASE SALES and MAKE MONEY.**

Everything else is a means to this end.

---

## Decision Filter

Before ANY action on DLM, ask:

> "Does this directly increase sales or revenue?"

- **YES** → Do it
- **NO** → Why are we doing it? Reconsider.
- **INDIRECTLY** → How many steps to revenue? Prefer direct impact.

---

## Priority Stack

1. **Revenue-generating activities** — Listings, pricing, promotions, conversion
2. **Traffic-generating activities** — SEO, marketing, ads, social
3. **Trust-building activities** — Reviews, site quality, customer service
4. **Infrastructure** — Only when it unblocks the above

---

## Anti-Patterns (Avoid)

❌ Perfecting things that don't drive sales
❌ Analysis paralysis — ship and iterate
❌ Spending time on low-traffic pages
❌ Features nobody asked for
❌ "Nice to have" over "need to have"

---

## The Question

When stuck or choosing between tasks, ask:

**"What will make the cash register ring?"**

Do that first.
