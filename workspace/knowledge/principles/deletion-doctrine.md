# Principle: The Deletion Doctrine
*Priority: P0*
*Source: Council Three Visionaries Debate, 2026-01-28*
*Inspired by: Elon Musk's 5-Step Algorithm*

## Rule
Before building, optimizing, or automating anything, run the 5-step filter:
1. **Question:** Should this exist? Who asked for it? What revenue or customer impact does it have?
2. **Delete:** If it can't justify its existence, delete it. Default to deletion. Track a 10% add-back rate â€” if you're not re-adding at least 10% of what you delete, you aren't deleting aggressively enough.
3. **Simplify:** Only after deletion. Reduce the remaining to its simplest possible form.
4. **Accelerate:** Compress cycle time. Faster iterations beat better plans.
5. **Automate:** Last step, not first. Never automate something that shouldn't exist.

## Enforcement
- The QA Pressure Loop asks "should this exist?" as its FIRST check on every output
- Every new procedure/file must justify its existence or be rejected
- Quarterly "deletion audit" â€” review all procedures, files, and agents for cut candidates
