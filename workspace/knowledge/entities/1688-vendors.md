# 1688 Trusted Vendors

*Track reliable vendors for future sourcing.*

## How to Use This File

When a vendor passes the 5-Point Check (score 6+) AND we successfully receive quality products, add them here.

**Before sourcing new products:** Check this list first for vendors we already trust.

## Vendors to Avoid

*(Document bad experiences so we don't repeat them)*

### Template
```
## [Store Name]
- **URL:** [link]
- **Issue:** [what went wrong — non-delivery, quality, etc.]
- **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
- **Action:** BLACKLISTED
```

## Notes

- Vendors can change over time — re-verify if 6+ months since last order
- "Trusted" means they delivered quality on at least 1 order
- Still run basic checks even on trusted vendors (stock availability, etc.)
