## 5. FACEBOOK PAGE

**Page:** facebook.com/dresslikemommy  
**Name:** Dresslikemommy.com  
**Followers:** 5,900  
**Category:** Women's clothing store

### ⚠️ Major Issues
1. **Page is INACTIVE** — last visible posts from **March 2019 and August 2019** (~7 years dormant)
2. **11 unread Messenger messages** — potential customers ignored
3. **Damaging comments visible:**
   - "DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY! My items were suppose to arrive 5-12 days..."
   - "BUYER BEWARE: THIS IS A SCAM COMPANY"
4. Posts had angry reactions (8 angry on one post)
5. No featured/pinned content

7. Bio: "Best online store for mother and daughter selection of matching dresses and outfits for every occasion"

---

## 6. OVERALL DIAGNOSIS

### The Good
- **13-year-old domain** — valuable for SEO authority
- **5,900 Facebook followers** — existing audience
- Products have proper structured data (75 valid snippets)
- HTTPS is properly configured
- Shopify platform is solid
- Product variety spans key niches (mommy & me, daddy & me, couples, maternity, holiday)

### The Bad
- **Zero sales** in recent months — the business is functionally dead
- **0% conversion rate** — nobody is buying
- ~10-20 sessions/day — negligible traffic
- ALL advertising platforms are dormant (Facebook, Google, Microsoft)
- Facebook page abandoned since 2019
- 11 unanswered customer messages
- Google Ads verification incomplete

### The Critical
- **Google Merchant Center: MISREPRESENTATION FLAG** — products blocked from Google Shopping and Free Listings in US and UK. This is the #1 priority to fix.
- **Negative reviews on Facebook** calling it a "scam" — destroys trust
- **4,885 pages not indexed** vs only 304 indexed — Google isn't seeing most of the store
- **No active marketing** of any kind
