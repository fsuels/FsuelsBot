# Goal Hierarchy — Dress Like Mommy
*Source: 4-Thinker Council (2026-01-28)*
*Rule: If a task doesn't map to this tree → DELETE IT*

## Level 0: Business Objective
**DLM sustainably profitable (≥20% net margin)**

## Level 1: Strategic Levers
- ↑ AOV (Average Order Value)
- ↑ CVR (Conversion Rate)
- ↓ CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost)
- ↓ Ops Time (Manual work per order)

## Level 2: System Goals
- Faster product iteration (more listings, better quality)
- Lower human review minutes per day
- Higher task success rate (agent outputs that ship)
- Unblock distribution channels (GMC, social, SEO)

## Level 3: Weekly Outcomes
- +1 winning product added/improved
- +1 conversion improvement shipped
- −1 manual workflow automated or eliminated
- Research: 1 actionable competitive insight

## Level 4: Daily Tasks
- One reversible change shipped
- One learning extracted and documented
- One system improvement (prompt, rubric, or process)

## Current Priority Stack (Jan 2026)
1. **Unblock GMC** — distribution is blocked, nothing else matters until ads work
2. **Valentine's Day** — 17 days, seasonal revenue window closing
3. **Store trust** — ScamAdviser score, reviews, social proof
4. **Product catalog** — descriptions, SEO, collections
5. **System improvement** — compound loop, personas, scoring
