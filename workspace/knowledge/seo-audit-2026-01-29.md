## 2. Critical Issues

### A. NOT RANKING for Primary Keywords
**Search: "mommy and me dresses matching outfits"**
- dresslikemommy.com: **NOT IN TOP 10**
- Competitors ranking:
  1. Ivy City Co
  2. Bailey's Blossoms
  3. Sparkle In Pink
  4. PatPat
  5. Show Me Your Mumu
  6. Posh Peanut
  7. Amazon
  8. Lilly Pulitzer
  9. The Children's Place
  10. Kyte Baby

### B. Duplicate Collections (SEO Cannibalization)
These duplicate collections compete with each other and dilute ranking power:

| Collection | Count | Issue |
|------------|-------|-------|
| Valentine's Day Matching Outfits | 2 collections | 10 products + 7 products (same name) |
| Popular Mommy & Me | 2 collections | Both have 368 products, identical filter |
| Mommy & Me variants | 5+ collections | All point to same 368 products |
| Family Matching variants | 3 collections | All point to same 214 products |

### C. Empty Collections (Wasted Crawl Budget)
These should be deleted or hidden:
- ACCESSORIES: 0 products
- Combinations: 0 products
- Headbands: 0 products
- Christmas Dresses: 0 products

### D. Collection Titles Too Long (>60 chars)
- "Daddy & Me Clothing | Stylish & Affordable Matching Looks for Dads and Kids" (76 chars)
- "Mommy & Me Matching Outfits | Dress the Part for Any Occasion" (63 chars)
- "Popular Family Matching Outfits | Create Special Memories" (58 chars)

### E. Generic Meta Descriptions
All collections show the same boilerplate in search results:
> "Dresslikemommy is the perfect place to find adorable and top-notch quality matching outfits..."

Each collection needs unique, keyword-rich descriptions.

### F. Microsoft Channel Exclusions
Most collections are "Excluded from Microsoft Channel" - needs investigation to understand why and if intentional.
