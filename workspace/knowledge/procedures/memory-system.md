# Memory System Architecture
*Master procedure document — how memory works in this system*
*Created: 2026-01-28 | Source: Council session 2026-01-28*

## Overview

The memory system has 4 layers, each serving a different purpose:

| Layer | File(s) | Purpose | Mutability |
|-------|---------|---------|------------|
| 1. Raw Capture | `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` | Daily session logs | Append-only per day |
| 2. Event Ledger | `memory/ledger.jsonl` | Structured, searchable events | **Append-only, NEVER edited** |
| 3. Knowledge Base | `knowledge/` | Curated, canonical knowledge | Updated by consolidation |
| 4. Recall Pack | `recall/pack.md` | Session context injection | Regenerated daily + on-demand |

**Information flows DOWN:** Raw logs → extracted into ledger → consolidated into knowledge → surfaced in recall pack.

**The ledger is the source of truth.** Knowledge files are derived views. If they contradict the ledger, the ledger wins.

---

## Layer 1: Raw Capture (`memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`)

**What:** Freeform daily logs written during sessions. Everything noteworthy goes here.

**Rules:**
- One file per day, named `YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- Append-only within the day (don't delete earlier entries)
- Include timestamps for significant events
- At end of each session, add a `## Priority Extracts` section:

```markdown
## Priority Extracts
- [P0] Client X deadline moved to Feb 15
- [P1] Decided on tiered pricing model
- [P2] User prefers bullet points over paragraphs
```

**This is what we already do.** No changes needed to daily logging.

---

## Layer 2: Event Ledger (`memory/ledger.jsonl`)

**What:** Append-only JSONL file. One structured event per line. NEVER edited or deleted.

**This is the most important file in the system.** It's the immutable record of everything that matters.

### Event Schema

```json
{
  "ts": "2026-01-28T14:03:11-05:00",
  "id": "EVT-20260128-001",
  "type": "commitment",
  "priority": "P0",
  "content": "Follow up Client X by Feb 1",
  "entity": "client_x",
  "tags": ["sales", "deadline"],
  "source": "memory/2026-01-28.md",
  "session": "main"
}
```

### Fields

| Field | Required | Type | Description |
|-------|----------|------|-------------|
| `ts` | Yes | ISO 8601 | When this was recorded |
| `id` | Yes | String | Unique ID: `EVT-YYYYMMDD-NNN` |
| `type` | Yes | Enum | See Event Types below |
| `priority` | Yes | Enum | P0, P1, P2, or P3 |
| `content` | Yes | String | Human-readable description |
| `entity` | No | String | Primary entity (snake_case) |
| `tags` | No | Array | Categorization tags |
| `source` | Yes | String | Where this info came from (`"live"` for real-time extraction) |
| `session` | No | String | Session identifier |
| `related` | No | Array | IDs of related events (Memory Chains) |
| `supersedes` | No | String | ID of event this corrects/replaces (Supersession Protocol) |
| `status` | No | String | For commitments: `"open"` or `"closed"` (Open Loops) |

### Event Types (7 canonical types)

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `fact` | A piece of information | "Francisco's birthday is March 11, 1981" |
| `decision` | A choice that was made | "Focus 100% on DLM profitability first" |
| `preference` | User preference or style | "Prefers open source tools over proprietary" |
| `commitment` | Something promised or owed | "Follow up with BuckyDrop support by Jan 30" |
| `constraint` | A limitation or rule | "$0 extra budget for any new tools" |
| `procedure` | How something should be done | "WhatsApp: draft in Telegram, Francisco copies" |
| `relationship` | Connection between entities | "Scott is BuckyDrop support contact" |

**Use tags instead of types for:** `insight` (tag on a fact), `milestone` (tag on any event), `conflict` (auto-detected by integrity checks). This keeps the type system lean while preserving all information.

### Priority Levels

| Priority | Retention | Description | Examples |
|----------|-----------|-------------|----------|
| P0 | **PERMANENT** | Core identity, security, critical rules | Budget constraint, security rules, core directives |
| P1 | **INDEFINITE** | Important business info, key relationships | Business decisions, project status, account IDs |
| P2 | Archive 90 days | Session context, minor preferences | Tool tips, formatting preferences |
| P3 | Archive 30 days | Ephemeral, one-time events | Temp tasks, transient status updates |

### Rules

1. **NEVER edit or delete lines** from ledger.jsonl
2. **To correct info:** Append a NEW event with `"supersedes": "EVT-XXX"` — old event stays but stops being surfaced
3. **IDs are sequential per day:** EVT-20260128-001, EVT-20260128-002, etc.
4. **Always include source:** Where did you learn this? Use `"live"` for real-time extraction during conversations
5. **Memory Chains:** When writing an event related to previous events, add `"related": ["EVT-XXX", "EVT-YYY"]`
6. **Open Loops:** Commitment events should include `"status": "open"`. When fulfilled, append a closing event with `"status": "closed"`

---

## Layer 3: Knowledge Base (`knowledge/`)

**What:** Curated, structured markdown files organized by category. Think of it as a wiki.

### Directory Structure

```
knowledge/
├── entities/          # People, companies, projects, accounts
├── procedures/        # How-to guides for the AI
├── principles/        # Standing rules, preferences, constraints
└── insights/          # Learned patterns, wisdom, technical lessons
```

### Entity Files (`knowledge/entities/`)

One file per important entity. Canonical reference for everything known about it.

**Naming:** `entity-name.md` (kebab-case)

**Template:**
```markdown
# Entity Name
*Type: person | company | project | account | tool*
*Last updated: YYYY-MM-DD*

## Summary
One paragraph overview.

## Key Facts
- Fact 1 [source: memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md] [verified: YYYY-MM-DD]
- Fact 2 [source: ...] [verified: ...]

## Relationships
- Related to: [other entity] — [relationship description]

## Active Context
[Anything currently relevant — open tasks, recent changes, pending items]

## History
[Timeline of significant events]
```

### Procedure Files (`knowledge/procedures/`)

How-to guides that tell the AI how to do things.

**Template:**
```markdown
# Procedure: [Name]
*Last updated: YYYY-MM-DD*
*Source: [where this procedure was established]*

## When to Use
[Trigger conditions]

## Steps
1. Step one
2. Step two
3. ...

## Notes
[Edge cases, common mistakes, tips]
```

### Principle Files (`knowledge/principles/`)

Standing rules that should always be followed.

**Template:**
```markdown
# Principle: [Name]
*Priority: P0/P1*
*Established: YYYY-MM-DD*
*Source: [who established this and why]*

## Rule
[Clear statement of the rule]

## Rationale
[Why this rule exists]

## Exceptions
[When this rule can be bent or broken]
```

### Insight Files (`knowledge/insights/`)

Patterns, lessons, and wisdom learned from experience.

**Template:**
```markdown
# Insight: [Name]
*Learned: YYYY-MM-DD*
*Source: [how we learned this]*

## The Insight
[What we learned]

## Evidence
[What happened that taught us this]

## Application
[How to use this knowledge going forward]
```

### Update Rules

1. Knowledge files ARE mutable — they represent current understanding
2. Always note `[verified: YYYY-MM-DD]` on facts
3. When updating, note what changed and why at the bottom
4. Consolidation sub-agent updates these nightly
5. Can also be updated manually during sessions when new info emerges

### Confidence Decay (Binding vs Decayable)

Events are split into two decay regimes:

**Binding types (NO automatic decay):**
- `commitment` — active until explicitly satisfied/withdrawn/violated
- `constraint` — permanent unless superseded or invalidated
- `procedure` — permanent unless superseded
- `decision` — permanent unless superseded

Binding types can NEVER be removed from the pack by decay alone. They require an explicit status transition event in the ledger. This prevents the agent from silently forgetting obligations.

**Decayable types (normal confidence decay):**
- `fact` — warning at 30 days unverified, drop from pack at 90 days
- `preference` — stale if not referenced in 60 days
- `relationship` — warning at 60 days, drop at 120 days

**Rules for knowledge files:**
- Every fact in a knowledge file MUST have `[verified: YYYY-MM-DD]`
- **< 30 days:** Fresh ✅
- **30-60 days:** Aging ⚠️ — flag `[⚠️ STALE]`
- **> 60 days:** Stale ❌ — drop from recall pack unless explicitly relevant
- Stale facts are NOT deleted — they stay in knowledge files, just aren't surfaced
- Re-verification: when a fact is confirmed current, update its `[verified: date]`

---

## Layer 4: Recall Pack (`recall/pack.md`)

**What:** A single curated document loaded at session start. Contains EXACTLY what the AI needs to know.

**This is the most important innovation.** Instead of loading all files (too much) or nothing (too little), we load a carefully curated summary of what matters RIGHT NOW.

**One file. One read.** No splits, no indirection. "More with less."

### Pack Sections

```markdown
# Recall Pack — YYYY-MM-DD
## 🔴 P0 CONSTRAINTS — Rules that must never be violated
## 🎯 THE MANTRA — Core mission
## 📋 OPEN COMMITMENTS — Oldest first, with status and age
## ⏳ WAITING ON — External dependencies
## 🎯 TODAY'S FOCUS — Priority work for the day
## 🧠 CONTEXT — Current projects, recent decisions, Francisco's state
## 📚 PROCEDURES — Key operational procedures
## 🔑 ACCOUNTS — Quick reference account IDs
```

**Note:** 7-Day Forecast was removed per Council Round 3 consensus (all 3 AIs agreed). Without structured due dates and external data, forecasts were speculative noise wasting pack budget. Those ~200 words are now available for actual commitments and context.

### Open Loops (Commitment Tracking)

Commitment-type events in the ledger have a `"status"` field: `"open"` or `"closed"`.
- The delta pack ALWAYS surfaces the **top 3 oldest open commitments**
- When a commitment is fulfilled, append a new event with `"status": "closed"`
- This prevents things from falling through the cracks

### Supersession Protocol

When a new fact contradicts an old one:
- The new event includes `"supersedes": "EVT-XXX"` pointing to the old event ID
- The recall pack builder automatically **excludes superseded events**
- The old event stays in the ledger (never deleted) but stops being surfaced
- This is **memory self-cleaning** — the system corrects itself

### Deterministic Pack Builder Rules

The pack is NOT a summary lottery. It follows **explicit, deterministic rules** so output is predictable and debuggable.

**Fixed Section Order** (always in this order, no rearranging):
1. 🔴 P0 CONSTRAINTS — always included, no exceptions
2. 🎯 THE MANTRA — always included (1 line)
3. 📋 OPEN COMMITMENTS — oldest first, with status and age
4. ⏳ WAITING ON — derived from open commitments with external dependencies
5. 🎯 TODAY'S FOCUS — top 3-5 priority items for the day
6. 🧠 CONTEXT — current state of active projects
7. 📚 PROCEDURES — key operational procedures (compact)
8. 🔑 ACCOUNTS — quick reference IDs (compact)

**Word Budgets Per Section** (total ≤ 3,000 words):
| Section | Budget | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| P0 CONSTRAINTS | 200 | Fixed, rarely changes |
| MANTRA | 20 | One line |
| OPEN COMMITMENTS | 500 | All open loops, oldest first |
| WAITING ON | 150 | One-liner per dependency |
| TODAY'S FOCUS | 300 | Top priorities only |
| CONTEXT | 800 | Active projects, recent decisions |
| PROCEDURES | 500 | Essential how-tos |
| ACCOUNTS | 200 | IDs only, no descriptions |
| **Buffer** | 330 | For overflow in any section |

**Explicit Inclusion Rules:**
- P0 events → ALWAYS in P0 CONSTRAINTS section
- Open commitments (status: "open", not superseded) → ALWAYS in OPEN COMMITMENTS
- Superseded events → NEVER included anywhere
- Expired P3 (>30 days) → excluded
- Expired P2 (>90 days) → excluded
- Stale facts (>30 days unverified) → flagged with ⚠️ if included

**Simple Conflict Detection:**
- When two active facts about the same entity contradict → include BOTH with ⚠️ CONFLICT flag
- Example: `⚠️ CONFLICT: EVT-042 says X, EVT-067 says Y — needs resolution`
- Conflicts are surfaced, not silently resolved

**General Rules:**
1. **Regenerated at 3 AM daily** by consolidation sub-agent
2. **Can be regenerated on-demand** during sessions if context changes
3. **Must stay under 3,000 words** — brevity is essential
4. **P0 section is ALWAYS included** regardless of length
5. **Prioritize recency** — last 48h > last week > last month
6. **Include entity context** for any entity likely to come up today

### Trigger-Based Expansion (`recall/triggers.json`)

When certain words appear in user input, load additional knowledge files:

```json
{
  "triggers": [
    {
      "patterns": ["shopify", "store", "products", "DLM", "dress like mommy"],
      "load": ["knowledge/entities/dress-like-mommy.md"]
    },
    {
      "patterns": ["buckydrop", "supplier", "shipping", "orders"],
      "load": ["knowledge/entities/buckydrop.md"]
    },
    {
      "patterns": ["budget", "cost", "price", "spend", "pay"],
      "load": ["knowledge/principles/budget-rules.md"]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Note:** Trigger-based loading is a future enhancement. For now, the recall pack itself provides sufficient context. Triggers will be implemented when we have enough knowledge files to justify dynamic loading.

## Live Extraction (During Sessions)

**Don't wait for consolidation.** When something important happens during a conversation, append it to the ledger immediately:

1. Identify the event (decision, commitment, fact, insight, etc.)
2. Determine priority (P0-P3)
3. Get the next sequential ID for today (`EVT-YYYYMMDD-NNN`)
4. Append the JSON line to `memory/ledger.jsonl`

**When to live-extract:**
- Francisco makes a decision → log it NOW
- A commitment is made → log it NOW
- A new P0 constraint is established → log it NOW
- A significant milestone is reached → log it NOW
- An important fact is discovered → log it NOW

**When to leave for consolidation:**
- Routine session events (P2/P3)
- Information already captured in the daily log
- Minor updates that don't need immediate recall

Live extraction means the ledger stays current. The 3 AM consolidation catches anything missed and rebuilds the recall pack.

---

## Index Files (`memory/index/`)

**What:** Minimal index to prevent expensive full-ledger scans. Only one index is maintained.

| File | Content | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| `memory/index/open-loops.json` | Array of open commitment event IDs | Surface open commitments in pack |

**Note:** `entities.json` and `tags.json` were removed per Council Round 3 consensus — they are derivable on-the-fly during consolidation and were a maintenance/corruption risk. Only `open-loops.json` is actively useful.

**Rebuilt incrementally** during nightly consolidation. **Full rebuild from scratch once weekly** (see Weekly Full Rebuild cron) as a correctness reset to prevent silent index drift.

## Checkpoint (`memory/checkpoint.json`)

**What:** Tracks the last event processed by consolidation.

```json
{
  "last_processed_event_id": "EVT-20260128-018",
  "last_run_ts": "2026-01-28T04:00:00-05:00",
  "events_processed": 67
}
```

**Why:** Without this, consolidation must read the ENTIRE ledger every night. At 500+ events, that exceeds the context window and fails. With checkpoints, consolidation only processes NEW events since the last run.

## Memory Integrity (Test Suite)

**What:** Validation checks run after every nightly consolidation. Turns silent failures into loud ones.

### Structural Checks
- No duplicate event IDs
- Valid JSON on every ledger line
- Sequential IDs per day
- Valid supersession refs (every `supersedes` points to a real event ID)
- Valid related refs (every `related` ID exists)
- Consistent indexes vs ledger state
- Valid checkpoint

### Semantic Checks (Critical)
- **Commitment non-decay:** No binding-type events excluded from pack by decay alone
- **P0/P1 coverage:** Every active P0/P1 event appears in recall pack
- **Open-loop completeness:** Every open commitment in ledger has entry in open-loops.json
- **No dangling supersessions:** Every `supersedes` target exists

### Output
Write `memory/integrity-report.json` after each consolidation. If any check fails, flag in pack context with ⚠️.

## Entity Snapshot (`memory/entity-snapshot.json`)

**What:** Lightweight diffable receipt of derived state, generated after each consolidation.

```json
{
  "generated": "2026-01-28T03:00:00Z",
  "entities": ["Francisco", "DressLikeMommy", "BuckyDrop"],
  "entity_count": 12,
  "tag_counts": {"shopify": 5, "memory": 8},
  "active_events": 67,
  "binding_events": 15,
  "decayable_events": 52
}
```

**Purpose:** Compare snapshots across consolidations to detect entity drift, canonicalization issues ("Acme" vs "ACME"), and derivation bugs. Not a maintained index — a diagnostic tool.

---

## Consolidation Process

### When: 3 AM daily (cron-spawned sub-agent)

### Steps:

1. **Read** today's `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
2. **Extract** structured events → append to `memory/ledger.jsonl`
   - Identify facts, decisions, preferences, commitments, constraints, procedures, insights
   - Assign priority P0-P3
   - Tag with relevant entities and categories
3. **Update knowledge base**
   - New entities → create file in `knowledge/entities/`
   - New info about existing entities → update their file
   - New procedures → create in `knowledge/procedures/`
   - New principles/rules → create in `knowledge/principles/`
   - New insights → create in `knowledge/insights/`
4. **Regenerate recall pack** → rewrite `recall/pack.md`
   - Scan ledger for open commitments (type: commitment, no corresponding milestone)
   - Scan for P0 constraints
   - Check for upcoming deadlines
   - Summarize current project status
5. **Report** → write `knowledge/consolidation-reports/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
   - How many events extracted
   - What knowledge files were created/updated
   - Any conflicts detected

### Pruning (quarterly)

- P2 events older than 90 days → move to `memory/archive/`
- P3 events older than 30 days → move to `memory/archive/`
- P0 and P1 events are NEVER pruned

---

## Session Startup Procedure

At the start of every session:

1. Read `SOUL.md` (identity)
2. Read `USER.md` (human)
3. Read `recall/pack.md` (**the key step** — this replaces reading raw memory files)
4. Read today's `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (if exists — for today's raw context)
5. Read yesterday's `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (for continuity)

The recall pack provides the curated context. Daily files provide raw recent context. Together, they give the AI everything it needs without overloading the context window.

**In main sessions only:** Also read `MEMORY.md` (until it's fully replaced by the recall pack + knowledge base system).

---

## Migration from Current System

This system EVOLVES from what we have. Nothing is destroyed.

| Current | New | Action |
|---------|-----|--------|
| `memory/*.md` daily files | Same | Keep as-is (Layer 1) |
| `MEMORY.md` | Kept, becomes secondary | Keep but recall pack takes priority |
| `second-brain/` | `knowledge/` + `second-brain/` | New knowledge/ is structured; second-brain/ remains as "inbox" |
| No event ledger | `memory/ledger.jsonl` | Created with backfill |
| No recall pack | `recall/pack.md` | Generated from current state |
| No consolidation | 3 AM cron sub-agent | New cron job |
| heartbeat-state.json | Same | Keep as-is |

---

## Ledger Compaction (Event-Driven Archival)

**Problem:** At 150-400 events, the ledger becomes too large for reliable consolidation. Token overflow causes silent corruption.

**Solution:** Event-driven archival — chains are archived automatically 30 days after resolution. No arbitrary thresholds.

### When to Run
- Checked during nightly consolidation
- Triggered when resolved chains are older than 30 days with no new links

### How It Works
1. Scan ledger for fully resolved chains (commitment satisfied, fact fully superseded)
2. If chain has been resolved for 30+ days with no new links: archive it
3. For each archived chain: create ONE summary event capturing final state
4. **P0/P1 permanent constraints**: preserved as-is (never archived)
5. Archive old chain events to `memory/ledger-archive-YYYY.jsonl`
6. Write updated `memory/ledger.jsonl`
7. Reset checkpoint and rebuild indexes

**This is the ONE exception to append-only.** Compaction is a controlled, atomic rewrite — not an edit. The archive preserves full history. Scales naturally with actual usage, not calendar time.

## Git Versioning

Every nightly consolidation begins with:
```
git add memory/ knowledge/ recall/
git commit -m "pre-consolidation YYYY-MM-DD"
```

This creates automatic rollback points. If a consolidation corrupts state, `git revert` restores everything. Zero cost, massive safety net.

## Weekly Full Index Rebuild

Once per week (Sunday 4 AM cron), rebuild `memory/index/open-loops.json` from scratch by scanning the full ledger. This prevents silent drift from incremental-only updates. Think of it as defragmentation — the incremental updates work fine day-to-day, but a weekly full rebuild catches any accumulated bugs.

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Files Claude can read/write natively** — markdown + JSON + JSONL. No databases.
2. **Append-only ledger** — immutability prevents data loss (except during monthly compaction).
3. **Sub-agents for maintenance** — Claude IS the processor, no external scripts needed.
4. **Evolve, don't replace** — existing files stay. New system layers on top.
5. **Recall pack solves context window** — curated 3K words beats random 50K words.
6. **Priority system drives retention** — P0 permanent, P3 ephemeral.
7. **Minimal indexes** — only open-loops.json maintained; entities/tags derived on-the-fly.
8. **Git versioning** — automatic rollback points before every consolidation.
9. **Event-driven compaction** — archives resolved chains after 30 days, scales naturally.
10. **Weekly full rebuild** — correctness reset prevents silent index drift.
11. **Binding type immunity** — commitments, constraints, procedures, decisions never decay; require explicit status transitions.
12. **Memory test suite** — integrity checks after every consolidation turn silent failures into loud ones.
13. **Entity snapshots** — diffable receipts detect drift and canonicalization issues.
