# Project Start Contract

Type: procedure
Last updated: 2026-02-18

## Required First Response For Project Tasks

When the user clearly references a project alias (for example DLM, 123legaldoc, or fsuelsbot), do this before execution:

1. State the process you remember for that project.
2. State where you will look for inputs, evidence, or data.
3. State decision criteria and constraints.
4. Then execute.

## Response Template

Use this structure:

- Process I will follow
- Where I will look
- What I will produce
- Start execution

## Guardrails

- Do not ask the user to repeat known process details that are already in project memory.
- Ask questions only when a required input is missing or ambiguous.
- Keep the process explanation concise and operational.
