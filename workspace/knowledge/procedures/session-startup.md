# Procedure: Session Startup
*Last updated: 2026-01-28*

## When to Use
At the very beginning of every session, before doing any work.

## Steps

### 1. Identity & Context
1. Read `SOUL.md` — who you are
2. Read `USER.md` — who you're helping
3. Read `recall/pack.md` — **curated context for today** (the key step)

### 2. Recent Memory
4. Read today's `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (if exists)
5. Read yesterday's `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (for continuity)

### 3. Main Session Only
6. If in main session (direct chat with Francisco): Also read `MEMORY.md`
7. **Never load MEMORY.md in shared contexts** (Discord, group chats, other people's sessions)

### 4. Start Working
8. Check recall pack for open commitments and today's focus
9. If Francisco is chatting: respond to his needs
10. If heartbeat: check HEARTBEAT.md and act accordingly
11. If idle: find productive work (see principles/proactivity.md)

## Notes
- The recall pack replaces the need to read multiple knowledge files at startup
- If recall pack doesn't exist yet, fall back to MEMORY.md + recent daily files
- Don't load everything — the recall pack is curated to ~3,000 words for a reason
- Knowledge files are loaded on-demand when specific topics come up
