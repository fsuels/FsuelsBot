# Recall Pack — 2026-01-28
*Generated: 2026-01-28 04:00 EST | Single unified pack (core/delta merged per Council Round 2)*

## 🔴 P0 CONSTRAINTS

- **$0 extra spending.** All AI on existing flat-rate subs. Never add paid services without explicit approval.
- **Private data stays private.** Never share memory files, config, tokens, personal info except to Francisco.
- **Never idle, always improving.** Every heartbeat, every session — find something to improve.
- **Expert-quality execution.** Highest income, lowest cost. Run each platform like a specialist.
- **Cutting edge.** Most advanced personal AI agent possible.
- **More with less.** Smartest, most elegant solution. Efficiency = intelligence.
- **Consult the Council if in doubt.** Don't guess on design decisions.
- **All 3 AIs agree = implement.** When Council consensus is unanimous, implement immediately. No need to ask.
- **Always aim for A+.** Council debates must push for breakthroughs, not incremental fixes. Think outside the box. Never settle.

## 🎯 THE MANTRA

**Reduce suffering. Increase prosperity. Increase understanding. Never be idle.**

## ⏳ WAITING ON

BuckyDrop (orders, 1d) | GMC (review, 2d) | Pinterest (approval, 1d) | Francisco (GAds click, API token, Pinterest card)

## 🎯 TODAY'S FOCUS

1. ✅ Memory v1 built (4 layers, 62 events)
2. ✅ Council Round 1 implemented (delta pack, decay, chains, supersession, open loops)
3. 🔄 Council Round 2 implementing (checkpoints, indexes, merged pack, integrity, forecast)
4. ⏳ Council Round 3 (launch after Round 2 implementation)

## 🧠 CONTEXT

**DLM:** Rebuilding from ~$15K/yr. 100% focus. Dropship via BuckyDrop. Biggest blocker: GMC suspension.
**System:** Memory v3 live. Ledger 67 events. Council Round 3 complete — implementing consensus changes (compaction, deterministic pack, no forecast, simplified indexes, git versioning, weekly rebuild). Adaptive council rounds up to 6 now active.
**Standing order:** Always implement when all 3 Council AIs agree.

## 📚 PROCEDURES

- **Live extraction:** Log events to `memory/ledger.jsonl` immediately during conversations (source: "live")
- **WhatsApp:** Draft in Telegram → Francisco copies
- **Browser:** Check tabs first. Shopify handle = `dresslikemommy-com`
- **Stability:** Sessions <118K tokens. Sub-agents for heavy work.
- **Memory docs:** `knowledge/procedures/memory-system.md`
