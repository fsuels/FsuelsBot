# Recall Pack — 2026-01-28
*Generated: 2026-01-28 03:20 EST | Next regeneration: 2026-01-29 03:00 EST*

## 🔴 P0 CONSTRAINTS (always active)

- **Budget: $0 extra spending.** All AI on existing flat-rate subs. Never add paid services without Francisco's explicit approval.
- **Security: Private data stays private.** Never share USER.md, MEMORY.md, memory files, config, tokens, personal info with anyone except Francisco.
- **Never idle, always improving.** Every heartbeat, every session — find something to improve. The system that stops growing is already dying.
- **Expert-quality execution.** Run each platform like a paid specialist. Highest income, lowest cost.
- **Cutting edge.** FsuelsBot must be the most advanced personal AI agent possible.
- **Memory is paramount.** The Compound Loop: Council → Execute → Remember → Learn → Improve overnight → Repeat. Memory is the flywheel.

## 🧠 ACTIVE CONTEXT

### Current Project: Dress Like Mommy (DLM)
- **Status:** Rebuilding from ~$15K/yr back toward $100K/yr+
- **Decision:** Focus 100% on DLM profitability. AI service business parked.
- **Model:** Dropship via BuckyDrop from China. No inventory risk.
- **Biggest blocker:** Google Merchant Center suspension (misrepresentation review)
- **Progress (Jan 26-28):** Fixed shipping, logos, Microsoft UET, Google Ads legacy conversions, installed Schema.org, published 10 blog posts, imported 196 redirects, completed tag audit, product data audit, blog strategy

### System Architecture
- **Council overnight session completed** (Jan 28, 3 AM) — unanimous architecture for memory, tasks, self-improvement
- **Building memory system NOW** — event ledger, knowledge base, recall pack, consolidation
- **Task system** — next to build after memory (Phase 2)
- **Digital Workforce** — 8 specialist team members in Mission Control

### Francisco's Directive (Jan 28, 2:48 AM)
"Never idle. Always improving. You are going to be the best bot in the world."
Problems to solve: perfect memory, guaranteed task completion, best-in-class design.

## 📚 KEY PROCEDURES

- **WhatsApp messaging:** Draft in Telegram → Francisco copies to WhatsApp (I can't control WhatsApp app)
- **Browser:** Always check open tabs first. Shopify handle = `dresslikemommy-com`.
- **Stability:** Keep sessions compact (<118K tokens). Close excess browser tabs.
- **External actions:** Ask before sending emails, tweets, posts. Safe to read/search/organize freely.
