## DM Script A (cold)

Hey {{name}} — I help teams cut repetitive ops work with OpenClaw automations in 7 days. Typical outcome: 5–15 hours/week saved + faster response times. Want a free 3-point teardown of your workflow?

## Follow-up 1 (24h)

Can I send the 3-point teardown today? No pitch, just concrete fixes + expected impact.

## Follow-up 2 (72h)

Last ping — if this isn’t a priority now, all good. If it is, I can send the teardown in one message.

## Call Booking Reply

Perfect — I’ll send 3 specific improvements with expected time/cost impact, then we decide if we should implement.

## Objection Handlers

- **"No budget"** → Start with Discovery-only ($500), keep implementation optional.
- **"No time"** → Async-first: you send current process once; I return a teardown + implementation plan.
- **"Already using automation"** → Great, I focus on optimization + reliability (fewer breakages, faster handoffs).

## Daily Execution Targets

- 20 new outreaches
- 5 follow-ups
- 1 proof post
- Log all outcomes in the KPI tracker
