# 📋 Task Plans

This folder stores detailed plans for complex tasks.

## Naming Convention

```
T###-plan.md  — Plan for task T###
```

Example: `T215-plan.md` for task T215's execution plan.

## When Plans Are Created

Plans are required when task complexity score >= 5:

| Score | Requirement |
|-------|-------------|
| 0-4 | No plan needed |
| 5-7 | Light plan (self-approve) |
| 8+ | Full plan + human approval |

## Plan Statuses

- `draft` — Plan written, not yet approved
- `approved` — Ready to execute
- `in_progress` — Currently executing steps
- `complete` — All steps done, task finished
