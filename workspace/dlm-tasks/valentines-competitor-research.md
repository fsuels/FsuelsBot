## 5. Marketing Tactics to Copy

### 🚨 URGENT — Shipping Deadline Countdown
**Who does it:** Little Mia Bella
**How:** Site-wide banner: **"ORDER BY FEB 5TH for VALENTINES DELIVERY ❤️"**
**Copy this:** Add a countdown banner NOW. With 17 days to go, shipping deadlines create the #1 urgency driver.
- Suggested copy: "💕 Order by Feb 7 for guaranteed Valentine's Day delivery!"
- Add countdown timer to collection page and emails

### 💰 BOGO / Bundle Deals
**Who does it:** Ivy City Co ("GETMINI50" — buy adult, get mini 50% off)
**How:** Reduces perceived cost of buying both pieces
**Copy this:** "Buy Mom's outfit, get Mini's 50% OFF" or "Complete the Set & Save 20%"
- This directly addresses the #1 friction point: buying 2 outfits feels expensive

### 💳 Buy Now Pay Later
**Who does it:** Sparkle In Pink (Afterpay — 4 payments of $4.99)
**How:** Shown prominently on every product page
**Copy this:** Enable Afterpay/Klarna/Shop Pay on Shopify — show split payment on product pages. "$19.99 or 4 payments of $4.99" makes premium pricing feel accessible.

### 📧 First-Purchase Discount
**Who does it:** PatPat (15% off first order, email + SMS signup), MomMeMatch (20% off code "Momme20")
**Copy this:** Pop-up: "💝 Get 15% off your first Valentine's order! Join our VIP Mamas list"

### 📝 Blog Content / Outfit Ideas
**Who does it:** Little Mia Bella ("6 Stylish Mommy and Me Valentine's Day Outfit Ideas"), Lola and the Boys, Styl'd Grace, Dreaming Loud
**What works:** Outfit idea posts with 4-6 looks, linking to products, targeting informational keywords
**Copy this:** Publish a blog post ASAP: "5 Adorable Valentine's Day Mommy & Me Outfit Ideas for 2026"
- Target keyword: "mommy and me valentine's day outfit ideas"
- Include product links to your collection

### 🏷️ Valentine's Collection Page with Subcategories
**Who does it:** PatPat (separate pages for pajamas, dresses, family matching, sibling matching), Sparkle In Pink (sweaters, pajamas, dresses sections)
**Copy this:** Don't just dump all V-Day products on one page. Organize by:
  - Valentine's Dresses
  - Valentine's Sweaters & Cardigans
  - Valentine's Pajamas
  - Valentine's Tees & Sweatshirts
  - Valentine's Accessories

### 🎁 Value-Add Inclusions
**Who does it:** Mia Belle Girls (sleep mask included with PJ sets)
**Copy this:** Include a small bonus item — heart-shaped hair clips, stickers, mini card — with orders over $50. Creates unboxing moments and social shares.

### 📸 Photoshoot Marketing Angle
**Who does it:** Little Mia Bella ("Have a photoshoot coming up? We're here to help!"), Ivy City Co (entire brand built on photo-worthy dresses)
**Copy this:** February is PEAK for Valentine's mini portrait sessions. Target photographer partnerships and use language like: "Perfect for Valentine's Day photoshoots 📸"

### 📱 Social Media UGC
**Who does it:** Bailey's Blossoms ("Cutie Contest"), MeUndies (#MatchMeUndies campaign)
**Copy this:** Launch a hashtag: **#DressLikeMommyValentine** — "Share your twinning Valentine's look for a chance to be featured + win a $50 gift card"

### 🛒 Sold Separately + Clear Instructions
**Who does it:** Sparkle In Pink ("EACH TOP SOLD SEPARATELY! Be sure to add each version/size"), PatPat, all Amazon sellers
**Copy this:** Make it crystal clear that mom and kid versions are sold separately — this is industry standard and avoids confusion/returns.

## 7. Key Takeaways & Action Items

### What the Top Competitors Are Doing Right

| Tactic | Who | Impact |
|--------|-----|--------|
| Shipping deadline urgency banner | Little Mia Bella | Drives FOMO, immediate conversion |
| BOGO on matching sets | Ivy City Co | Overcomes "two outfits = expensive" objection |
| Dedicated V-Day subcategories | PatPat, Sparkle In Pink | Better SEO, easier shopping |
| Blog content for outfit ideas | Little Mia Bella, Lola & Boys | Captures informational searches, builds authority |
| Sleep mask / bonus item with PJs | Mia Belle Girls | Increases perceived value, unboxing moment |
| Afterpay on every product page | Sparkle In Pink | Makes $20-35 items feel even more accessible |
| Gender-neutral options (boy mom) | Little Mia Bella | Expands addressable market significantly |
| Necklace gift sets as upsell | Little Mia Bella | Low-cost, high-margin AOV booster |
| Size-inclusive (XXS to 5X) | Ivy City Co | Untapped by most boutiques |
| Matching accessories (boots, bags) | Little Mia Bella, Mia Belle | Completes the look, increases basket |

### Market Gaps / Opportunities for DLM

1. **Boy Mom Valentine's Outfits** — Little Mia Bella does this but most competitors don't. "Mom and Son" Valentine's matching is underserved.
2. **Valentine's Bundle / Gift Box** — No competitor offers a curated "Valentine's Gift Box" (outfit + accessory + card). DLM could own this.
3. **Galentine's Day (Feb 13)** — Almost no competitor targets this. "Mommy & Bestie" or "Big Sister & Little Sister" matching could capture a different buyer.
4. **Same-Day / Rush Shipping** — Most boutiques take 3-5 days. Offering guaranteed express could capture late buyers (Feb 8-12).
5. **Customization/Personalization** — Only Up2 Boutique offers this. Adding names or monograms to Valentine's pieces would be a differentiator.

### Immediate Action Items (Next 48 Hours)

- [ ] **Add shipping deadline banner** to entire site and Valentine's collection
- [ ] **Create Valentine's collection page** with subcategory navigation
- [ ] **Set up BOGO or bundle deal** (buy mom outfit, kid outfit 20-50% off)
- [ ] **Publish Valentine's outfit ideas blog post** targeting "mommy and me valentine outfit ideas 2026"
- [ ] **Update meta titles/descriptions** with top Valentine's keywords
- [ ] **Launch email blast** to existing customers with Valentine's collection + deadline
- [ ] **Post Valentine's content on social** — outfit flat lays, mom+kid lifestyle shots
- [ ] **Enable Afterpay/Klarna** if not already active
- [ ] **Plan a social UGC campaign** with branded hashtag
