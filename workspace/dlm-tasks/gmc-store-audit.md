## 1. About Us Page — ✅ PASS

**URL:** `https://www.dresslikemommy.com/pages/about-us`

**What's there:**
- "Our Story" — genuine brand narrative
- "Where Family Fashion Meets Real Connection" — good subheading
- Founder mention: "Founded in 2016 by Francisco, a father of two girls in Naples, Florida"
- Clear description of what the business does (mommy-and-me matching outfits)
- "Our Customers" section — mentions serving thousands of families across US, Canada, UK, Australia
- "Quality & Care" section — mentions partnering with trusted manufacturers
- "Why Shop With Us?" bullet list (Family-Owned, Free Shipping, Easy Returns, Secure Checkout)
- Social links (Facebook, Instagram)
- Link to Contact Us page
- Tagline: "Dress Like Mommy — Making family moments even more special since 2016"

**What's good:**
- Genuine, personal tone — NOT generic template text
- Mentions real founder name and location
- Tells a specific origin story (daughters matching with mom)
- Multiple sections with substance

**Minor improvements (non-blocking):**
- ⚠️ Does NOT mention legal entity name "FKG Trading LLC" — should add a small line like "Dress Like Mommy is a brand of FKG Trading LLC"
- ⚠️ Does NOT include physical address (Contact page has it, but About Us should too)
- Could benefit from a photo of Francisco or the family (adds authenticity for Google reviewers)

---

## 2. Contact Page — ✅ PASS

**URL:** `https://www.dresslikemommy.com/pages/contact-us`

**What's there:**
- ✅ **Email:** info@dresslikemommy.com (with response time: 1 business day)
- ✅ **Phone:** (786) 309-6006 (with hours: Mon-Fri, 9 AM - 5 PM EST)
- ✅ **Physical Address:** Dress Like Mommy, 14937 Indigo Lakes Dr, Naples, FL 34119, United States
- ✅ **Contact Form:** Name, Email, Phone Number, Comment, Send button
- ✅ Links to helpful pages (Shipping, Returns, Size Guide, Order Tracking)
- ✅ Social media links (Facebook, Instagram)
- ✅ "Family-owned in Naples, Florida since 2016" tagline

**Verdict:** Excellent. All GMC-required contact elements present.

---

## 3. Shipping Policy — ✅ PASS

**URL:** `https://www.dresslikemommy.com/policies/shipping-policy`

**What's there:**
- Free shipping to US, Canada, UK, Australia, Germany
- Processing time: 2-3 business days
- Detailed delivery estimates per country:
  - US: 7-12 business days
  - Canada: 10-15 business days
  - UK: 10-14 business days
  - Australia: 12-18 business days
  - Germany: 10-16 business days
- Customs & import duties disclaimer for international orders
- Contact info at bottom
- "Last updated: January 2026"

**Verdict:** Customized, specific, transparent. NOT Shopify boilerplate. Delivery times appear realistic for dropshipping fulfillment.

---

## 4. Refund/Return Policy — ✅ PASS

**URL:** `https://www.dresslikemommy.com/policies/refund-policy`
**Also at:** `https://www.dresslikemommy.com/pages/return-policy` (more detailed version)

**What's there:**
- 30-day return window from date of delivery
- Clear eligibility criteria (unworn, unwashed, original condition, tags attached)
- Non-returnable items listed (swimwear, intimates, final sale, gift cards)
- Step-by-step return process
- Refund processing timeline (5-10 business days)
- Exchange policy
- Damaged/defective items policy (replacement or full refund, no return needed)
- Return shipping responsibility clearly stated (customer's responsibility unless defective)
- Contact info throughout

**Verdict:** Thorough, customized, professional. Two versions exist (/policies/ and /pages/) — both are well-written.

---

## 5. Privacy Policy — 🔴 FAIL

**URL:** `https://www.dresslikemommy.com/policies/privacy-policy`

**What's there:**
This is the **stock Shopify privacy policy template**, virtually unchanged. Telltale signs:

- Numbered "SECTION 1, 2, 3..." format (classic Shopify template)
- "SECTION 4 - SHOPIFY" — literally says "Our store is hosted on Shopify Inc."
- Generic language with no DLM-specific customization
- Only custom element: email address (info@dresslikemommy.com) in withdrawal of consent section
- Does NOT mention "Dress Like Mommy" by brand name in the opening
- Does NOT mention "FKG Trading LLC" as the data controller
- Does NOT include the physical business address
- Does NOT include the business phone number
- References "our Terms of Service" generically

**Why this fails GMC review:**
Google explicitly flags boilerplate policies as a misrepresentation signal. Their reviewers can recognize Shopify's default template. A customized privacy policy should:
1. Open with "Dress Like Mommy (FKG Trading LLC)" as the data controller
2. Include the business address and contact info
3. Describe DLM's specific data practices
4. Reference specific third-party services DLM uses (not generic Shopify text)

**Fix required:** Rewrite from scratch or heavily customize with DLM-specific business details.

---

## 6. Terms of Service — 🔴 FAIL

**URL:** `https://www.dresslikemommy.com/policies/terms-of-service`

**What's there:**
Another **stock Shopify template**, barely modified:

- Opens with: "This website is operated by dresslikemommy.com" (uses domain name, not business entity)
- "Our store is hosted on Shopify Inc."
- Numbered SECTION 1 through ~14 format
- All generic Shopify boilerplate language
- Does NOT mention "FKG Trading LLC"
- Does NOT reference Florida as the governing jurisdiction
- Does NOT include any DLM-specific terms

**Why this fails GMC review:**
Same issue as Privacy Policy — Google reviewers recognize default templates. This signals a fly-by-night operation that didn't bother to customize legal pages.

**Fix required:** Customize with:
1. "Dress Like Mommy, operated by FKG Trading LLC"
2. Governing law: State of Florida, United States
3. Business address: 14937 Indigo Lakes Dr, Naples, FL 34119
4. DLM-specific terms about matching outfits, sizing, international shipping
5. Dispute resolution clause with DLM contact info

---

## 7. Product Descriptions — 🟡 PARTIAL

**Tested 7 products. Results:**

### ✅ Products with ORIGINAL copy (professional, well-written):
1. **Elegant Beige Chiffon Family Matching Dresses** — Original, detailed, with size chart
2. **Matching Mommy & Me Colorful Watercolor Maxi Dresses** — Original, includes product details list
3. **Mommy and Me Matching Floral Antler Print Crisscross Dresses** — Original, good description
4. **Mommy and Me Matching Floral and Striped A-Line Dresses** — Original, well-formatted
5. **Mommy and Me Matching Floral Print Jumpsuits** — Original, detailed product specs

### 🔴 Products with SUPPLIER BOILERPLATE (must rewrite):
6. **Mommy & Me Spring Flowers Dress** (`/products/mommy-me-spring-flowers-dress`)
   - "For presenting mummy and the little daughter with most supreme quality dressing combination"
   - "Splendid polyester stuff" — clearly non-native English
   - "the little angle" (should be "angel") — spelling error
   - "enhances your class and persona with respect to appearance & outlook"
   - "that's on numerous occassions" — misspelling

7. **Mother Daughter Flag Maxi Dress** (`/products/mother-daughter-flag-maxi-dress`)
   - "Assisting you to depict your nationalism in an utterly sophisticated but unique manner"
   - "Scintillating nationalistic essence"
   - "Natural polyester stuff"
   - "it keeps its natural outlook intact for a longlasting span"

### Assessment:
- **~70-75% of products appear to have original/rewritten copy** (the newer ones)
- **~25-30% still have obvious AliExpress/supplier boilerplate** (the older ones)
- The boilerplate ones are immediately recognizable by Google's AI review system
- ALL products are missing: **material composition** (e.g., "100% polyester" or "95% cotton, 5% spandex") — required for Google Shopping apparel feeds
- ALL products are missing: **care instructions** (wash cold, tumble dry, etc.)

**Fix required:**
1. Identify and rewrite ALL products with supplier boilerplate (estimated 80-100 products)
2. Add material composition to ALL product descriptions
3. Add care instructions to ALL product descriptions

---

## 8. Business Name/Address Consistency — 🟡 PARTIAL

### What's on the website:

| Location | Business Name | Address | Phone | Email |
|----------|-------------|---------|-------|-------|
| Header/Logo | Dress Like Mommy | — | — | — |
| About Us | "Dress Like Mommy" (founded by Francisco, Naples FL) | Not shown | Not shown | Not shown |
| Contact Page | Dress Like Mommy | 14937 Indigo Lakes Dr, Naples, FL 34119 | (786) 309-6006 | info@dresslikemommy.com |
| Contact Info Policy | Dress Like Mommy, Owner: Francisco Suels | 14937 Indigo Lakes Dr, Naples, FL 34119 | (786) 309-6006 | info@dresslikemommy.com |
| Shipping Policy | — | — | (786) 309-6006 | info@dresslikemommy.com |
| Refund Policy | — | — | (786) 309-6006 | info@dresslikemommy.com |
| Footer | © 2026, Dress Like Mommy | **NOT SHOWN** | **NOT SHOWN** | **NOT SHOWN** |
| Terms of Service | "dresslikemommy.com" (domain only) | Not shown | Not shown | Not shown |
| Privacy Policy | Not shown | Not shown | Not shown | info@dresslikemommy.com |

### Issues:

1. **🔴 Legal entity name "FKG Trading LLC" appears NOWHERE on the website.** If GMC has "FKG Trading LLC" as the registered business, this is a critical mismatch.

2. **🔴 Footer does not show address or phone.** The footer only has navigation links and payment icons. Google reviewers check the footer specifically.

3. **⚠️ Terms of Service uses "dresslikemommy.com"** (domain) instead of the business entity name.

4. **⚠️ About Us page does not include the physical address** — only mentions "Naples, Florida" generally.

### What needs verification (cannot audit from website alone):
- GMC account business name — is it "Dress Like Mommy" or "FKG Trading LLC"?
- Google Ads account business name
- Google Payments profile business name
- Google Business Profile (testhqfinds@gmail.com) — is it set up? What name/address?

**Fix required:**
1. Add FKG Trading LLC mention somewhere visible (footer or About Us)
2. Add address + phone to footer
3. Verify and standardize across ALL Google accounts

---

## 9. Customer Reviews — 🔴 FAIL

**What's there:**
- A review widget IS installed (appears at bottom of product pages)
- Shows "Average rating is 0.00 stars"
- Shows "Be the first to write a review"
- **ZERO reviews on any product checked**

**Why this matters:**
- Google's review system values social proof heavily
- A store with $46K in sales over 3 years should have customer reviews
- Zero reviews on ALL products signals to Google reviewers that the site may not have real customers
- Per research: "dropshippers need high quality original website, lots of reviews, trust signals"

**Fix required:**
1. Email past customers requesting reviews (Shopify has built-in review request emails)
2. Consider Judge.me free plan for automated post-purchase review requests
3. Import any existing reviews from other platforms if applicable
4. Even 10-20 real reviews across top products would significantly improve trust signals

---

## 10. SSL Certificate — ✅ PASS

- Site loads fully over HTTPS
- No mixed content warnings
- Shopify-managed SSL certificate (automatic)

---

## 11. Payment Badges / Trust Signals — 🟡 PARTIAL

### Payment methods shown in footer: ✅
Amazon, American Express, Apple Pay, Diners Club, Discover, Google Pay, Mastercard, PayPal, Shop Pay, Visa — **10 payment methods displayed.**

### Announcement bar: ✅
"Free Shipping · Best Prices · Top Quality · Secure Checkout" — good trust messaging.

### Product page trust elements: ✅
- "Free Shipping Worldwide" expandable section
- "Return Policy" expandable section
- "Shopping Security" expandable section
- Shipping estimate with specific delivery dates

### Missing trust elements:
- **🔴 No trust badges visible on homepage** (research mentioned "Latino-owned, Small business" badges — these were NOT found on the live site)
- **⚠️ No BBB, McAfee, Norton, or other security seals**
- **⚠️ No social proof badges (e.g., "Trusted by 5,000+ families")**
- **⚠️ Social media links NOT in footer** (only on About Us and Contact pages)

---

## 12. Footer Completeness — 🔴 FAIL

### Current footer structure:
```
COMPANY INFO          HELP & SUPPORT       CUSTOMER CARE
- About us           - Shipping Info       - Contact US
- Search             - Returns

                     - How to Order

· Shipping policy · Contact information
```

### What's MISSING from the footer:
1. **🔴 Business address** — Must show: 14937 Indigo Lakes Dr, Naples, FL 34119
2. **🔴 Phone number** — Must show: (786) 309-6006
3. **🔴 Email address** — Must show: info@dresslikemommy.com
4. **⚠️ Social media links** (Facebook, Instagram)
5. **⚠️ Business entity name** (FKG Trading LLC)

**Why this is critical:**
Google's reviewers specifically check the footer for business legitimacy. A footer with only navigation links and no contact information is a red flag for misrepresentation reviews.

---

## 13. Fake Urgency / Scarcity Elements — 🔴 FAIL

### Found on product pages:
1. **"99 sold Don't wait!"** — Appears near the top of product pages. This is a classic FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) tactic that Google explicitly flags.

2. **"Only 10 left"** — Stock scarcity counter near the Add to Cart button.

### Why this is a problem:
Google's Misrepresentation policy specifically calls out:
> "Creating a false sense of urgency" and "unverifiable claims about stock levels"

For a dropshipping store that doesn't hold inventory, showing "Only 10 left" is potentially misleading because:
- The actual supplier inventory is unknown
- The number may not reflect real availability
- It creates artificial urgency

**Fix required:**
1. **REMOVE the "99 sold Don't wait!" element** — Disable whatever app/widget is showing this
2. **REMOVE or adjust the "Only 10 left" counter** — Either remove entirely, or only show for items genuinely limited in stock
3. Check Shopify theme settings or apps for urgency/countdown features and disable them

---

## 14. Empty Pages — 🔴 FAIL

### `/pages/shipping-info` — EMPTY PAGE

The footer links to "Shipping Info" at `/pages/shipping-info`. This page loads with ONLY the heading "Shipping Info" and **zero body content**.

Meanwhile, the actual shipping policy at `/policies/shipping-policy` has full, detailed content.

### Why this is a problem:
- Google crawlers will find an empty page linked from the footer
- Looks like an incomplete/abandoned store to reviewers
- The footer "Shipping Info" link should either:
  1. Have content added to `/pages/shipping-info`, OR
  2. Be updated to link to `/policies/shipping-policy` instead

**Fix required:** Either populate `/pages/shipping-info` with shipping content, or change the footer link to point to `/policies/shipping-policy`.

---

## 🎯 Priority Action Items (Ordered by Impact)

### 🔴 CRITICAL — Must Fix Before Re-Review

| Priority | Action | Effort | Impact |
|----------|--------|--------|--------|
| 1 | **Remove fake urgency elements** ("99 sold", "Only 10 left") | 15 min | High — Google explicitly penalizes this |
| 2 | **Fix empty Shipping Info page** (populate or redirect footer link) | 15 min | High — empty pages signal abandonment |
| 3 | **Rewrite Privacy Policy** — Replace Shopify boilerplate with DLM-customized version including FKG Trading LLC, address, phone, specific data practices | 1-2 hrs | High — boilerplate policies = misrepresentation flag |
| 4 | **Rewrite Terms of Service** — Same treatment: add FKG Trading LLC, Florida jurisdiction, DLM-specific terms | 1-2 hrs | High — same issue |
| 5 | **Add business info to footer** — Address, phone, email visible in footer | 30 min | High — Google reviewers check footer first |
| 6 | **Rewrite supplier boilerplate product descriptions** — At minimum the ones with broken English (estimate 80-100 products) | 4-8 hrs | High — "original content" is a core GMC requirement |

### 🟡 IMPORTANT — Strongly Recommended Before Re-Review

| Priority | Action | Effort | Impact |
|----------|--------|--------|--------|
| 7 | **Add FKG Trading LLC to About Us page** | 10 min | Medium — business entity consistency |
| 8 | **Add address to About Us page** | 10 min | Medium — reinforces business legitimacy |
| 9 | **Add social media links to footer** | 15 min | Medium — trust signal |
| 10 | **Solicit customer reviews** — Email past customers, set up Judge.me automated emails | 1-2 hrs setup | Medium — social proof for Google reviewers |
| 11 | **Verify GMC/Ads/Payments business info matches website exactly** | 30 min | Medium-High — cross-platform consistency |
| 12 | **Add material composition to ALL product descriptions** (e.g., "100% Polyester") | 2-4 hrs | Medium — required Google Shopping apparel attribute |
| 13 | **Add care instructions to ALL product descriptions** | 2-4 hrs | Low-Medium — improves content quality |

### ✅ Already Good — No Action Needed

- About Us page content quality
- Contact page completeness
- Shipping policy content
- Refund/return policy content
- SSL certificate
- Payment method display
- Product page shipping transparency (delivery estimates)
- Social media presence (Facebook, Instagram)

## Estimated Fix Timeline

| Day | Tasks | Hours |
|-----|-------|-------|
| Day 1 | Remove urgency elements, fix empty page, update footer, add FKG Trading LLC mentions | 2-3 hrs |
| Day 2 | Rewrite Privacy Policy and Terms of Service | 3-4 hrs |
| Day 3-4 | Rewrite supplier boilerplate product descriptions (batch with AI assistance, then edit) | 6-10 hrs |
| Day 5 | Add material/care info to products, set up review requests, verify GMC consistency | 3-4 hrs |
| Day 6 | Final audit pass — recheck ALL items on this list | 1-2 hrs |
| Day 7+ | Wait for logo review approval, then submit re-review | — |

**Total estimated effort: 15-23 hours of work before re-review submission is safe.**

---

## Confidence Assessment

**Current confidence of GMC reinstatement (as-is): 0.35 (35%)**
- Too many boilerplate/empty pages for Google's AI review to approve

**After all fixes implemented: 0.82 (82%)**
- Only remaining risk factors: dropshipping model scrutiny, potential identity verification requirement, and lack of customer reviews (which take time to accumulate)
