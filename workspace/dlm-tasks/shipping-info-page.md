# Shipping Information

We're excited to get your order to you! Here's everything you need to know about how shipping works at Dress Like Mommy.

---

## Processing Time

Once you place your order, our team gets to work right away:

- **Order processing takes 2–3 business days**
- Business days are Monday through Friday (excluding U.S. holidays)
- You'll receive an email confirmation as soon as your order is placed, and a second email with your tracking number once it ships

During peak seasons (holidays, major sales events), processing may take an additional 1–2 business days. We'll always keep you updated.

## Shipping Times

### Standard Shipping

| Destination | Estimated Delivery |
|---|---|
| United States | 7–12 business days after processing |
| Canada | 10–15 business days after processing |
| International | 12–20 business days after processing |

**Please note:** These are estimates, not guarantees. Actual delivery times may vary based on your location, customs processing, and carrier conditions.

### Where Do Orders Ship From?

Our products are shipped from our **overseas fulfillment warehouse** to keep prices affordable for families. This means:

- Packages travel internationally to reach you
- Delivery takes a bit longer than domestic-only stores
- The quality and care we put into every item is worth the wait! 💛

We've chosen this model intentionally — it lets us offer beautiful matching outfits at prices that won't break the family budget.

## Order Tracking

Every order comes with tracking so you're never left wondering:

1. **Order confirmed** — You'll receive a confirmation email immediately after purchase
2. **Order shipped** — Once your package leaves our warehouse, we'll email you a tracking number
3. **Track your package** — Use the tracking number to follow your order's journey right to your door

**Tip:** Tracking updates may take 24–48 hours to appear after you receive your tracking number. This is normal — it just means your package is in transit to the first scan point.

If your tracking hasn't updated in more than 7 business days, please reach out to us and we'll investigate right away.

## Customs, Duties, and Taxes

### United States Orders

- **No customs or duties** — your order ships directly to you with no additional fees

### International Orders (Outside the U.S.)

If you're ordering from outside the United States, please be aware:

- **Import duties, taxes, and customs fees may apply** when your package arrives in your country
- These charges are set by your local government and are **the responsibility of the buyer**
- We have no control over these charges and cannot predict or prepay them
- Customs fees vary by country, product type, and order value

**We recommend** checking with your local customs office before ordering if you're unsure about potential fees.

**Important:** If a package is returned to us because customs duties were refused, we cannot issue a refund for shipping costs. The product cost will be refunded minus any return shipping fees incurred.

---

## Shipping Costs

Shipping costs are calculated at checkout based on your order total and destination. We regularly offer:

- **Free shipping promotions** — keep an eye on our homepage and email newsletter for current offers
- **Flat-rate shipping** on many items

The exact shipping cost will always be displayed before you complete your purchase — no surprises.

## Delivery Issues

### My Package Shows "Delivered" but I Haven't Received It

Don't panic — this happens occasionally. Here's what to do:

1. Check around your property (porches, side doors, mailbox, with neighbors)
2. Wait 24 hours — sometimes tracking updates before actual delivery
3. Contact your local carrier with your tracking number
4. If you still can't locate it, email us at **info@dresslikemommy.com** and we'll help sort it out

### My Package Is Taking Longer Than Expected

International shipping can sometimes experience delays due to:

- Customs processing times
- Carrier delays or route changes
- Severe weather or holiday backlogs
- Local postal service processing

If your order hasn't arrived within **20 business days** of the shipping confirmation, please contact us. We'll look into it and make sure you're taken care of.

### My Order Arrived Damaged

We're sorry if this happens! Please:

1. Take photos of the damaged packaging and items
2. Email us at **info@dresslikemommy.com** within **7 days** of receiving your order
3. We'll work with you on a replacement or refund — whichever you prefer

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Can I change my shipping address after ordering?**
If your order hasn't shipped yet, email us immediately at info@dresslikemommy.com and we'll do our best to update it. Once an order has shipped, we cannot change the delivery address.

**Do you ship to P.O. boxes?**
Yes, we can ship to P.O. boxes within the United States.

**Do you offer expedited shipping?**
At this time, we offer standard shipping only. We're exploring faster options and will update this page when they become available.

**Why does shipping take 7–12 days?**
Our products ship from an overseas warehouse, which allows us to offer high-quality matching outfits at family-friendly prices. The slightly longer shipping time is the trade-off — and our customers tell us it's worth the wait!

**Will I be charged sales tax?**
Sales tax is calculated based on your shipping destination and applicable local, state, and federal tax laws. Any applicable tax will be shown at checkout.
