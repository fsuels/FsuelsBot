## 1. About These Terms

These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the Dress Like Mommy website and all related services. When we say "we," "us," or "our," we mean FKG Trading LLC. When we say "you" or "your," we mean you — the person visiting our site or making a purchase.

We may update these Terms from time to time. The "Last Updated" date at the top will always reflect the most recent version. Continued use of the site after changes constitutes acceptance.

To use our website and make purchases, you must:

- Be at least **18 years of age** (or the age of majority in your jurisdiction)
- Have the legal capacity to enter into a binding agreement
- Provide accurate and complete information when placing an order

While we sell children's clothing, all purchases must be made by an adult. By placing an order, you confirm that you meet these requirements.

## 3. Your Account

If you create an account on our site:

- You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials
- You are responsible for all activity that occurs under your account

## 4. Products and Pricing

### Product Descriptions

We do our best to display our products accurately, including colors, sizes, and descriptions. However:

- Colors may appear differently depending on your screen settings
- Minor variations between the product photo and the actual item may occur
- We are not responsible for typographical errors in product descriptions

If you receive an item that is significantly different from its description, please contact us and we'll make it right.

### Pricing

- All prices are listed in **US Dollars (USD)** unless otherwise indicated
- Prices are subject to change without notice, but changes will not affect orders already placed and confirmed
- We reserve the right to correct pricing errors — if an item is listed at an incorrect price, we will notify you before processing the order and give you the option to cancel
- Prices do not include shipping costs, taxes, customs duties, or import fees, which are calculated at checkout or are the buyer's responsibility (see Section 5)

### Order Acceptance

Placing an order constitutes an offer to purchase. We reserve the right to refuse or cancel any order for reasons including:

- Product unavailability
- Pricing or description errors
- Suspected fraudulent activity
- Violation of these Terms

If we cancel your order, we will issue a full refund to your original payment method.

### Customs, Duties, and Taxes

For international orders (outside the United States):
