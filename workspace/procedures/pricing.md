# Pricing Procedure

_Updated: 2026-02-21_

## The Rule

```
MINIMUM PRICE = TOTAL COST ÷ 0.5
(50% profit after ALL costs including marketing)

Shortcut: TOTAL COST × 2 = minimum selling price
```

**Non-negotiable. No exceptions without Francisco's explicit approval.**

## Total Cost = ALL of These

| #   | Component              | Source                            | Notes                             |
| --- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| 1   | Product price          | 1688 listing                      | Convert CNY → USD                 |
| 2   | Domestic shipping      | BuckyDrop (factory → warehouse)   | Always present                    |
| 3   | International shipping | BuckyDrop (YunExpress → USA)      | Use adult weight, USA destination |
| 4   | Platform fees          | BuckyDrop (service + value-added) | Extracted during import           |
| 5   | Marketing allocation   | 15% of subtotal (items 1-4)       | Budget for ads/promotion          |
|     | **TOTAL COST**         | **Sum of 1-5**                    | **This is the floor**             |

**Do NOT skip any component.** A "cheap" product with expensive shipping is NOT cheap.

## Competitor Research (Required)

Before recommending a price, research what competitors sell similar products for.

**Where to check:**

- Amazon — search same product type
- Etsy — "mommy and me [product type]"
- Google Shopping — broader market view
- Direct competitors — PatPat, SHEIN, similar Shopify stores

**What to capture per product:**

- Price range (lowest → highest)
- Average price
- Whether they charge shipping separately
- Number of competitors found

**Minimum:** Check 3+ competitors. One data point is not research.

## Pricing Decision

```
TOTAL COST × 2 = Minimum Price (50% profit)
Competitor Average = Market Price
```

| Situation                  | Action                                                                |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Market price > our minimum | Price competitively within range. More margin = good.                 |
| Market price ≈ our minimum | Price at minimum. Tight but viable.                                   |
| Market price < our minimum | ⚠️ FLAG to Francisco. Options: cheaper source, lower margin, or skip. |

**Sweet spot:** Slightly below competitor average BUT always above our minimum.

| Domestic shipping          | $0.84                         |

| **TOTAL COST**             | **$17.48**                    |
| **Min price (×2)**         | **$34.96 → $34.99**           |
| Competitors                | $22.99 - $38.99 (Amazon/Etsy) |
| **Recommended**            | **$34.99 (margin: 50.1%)**    |

## Quick Reference

| Total Cost | Min Price | You Keep |
| ---------- | --------- | -------- |
| $10        | $20       | $10      |
| $15        | $30       | $15      |
| $20        | $40       | $20      |
| $25        | $50       | $25      |
| $30        | $60       | $30      |

---

## Compare-At Pricing (Optional)

Create perceived value with strikethrough pricing:

- Selling price: 2× cost (minimum)
- Compare-at: 2.5-3× cost (shows "sale")

Example: Cost $15 → Price $30 → Compare-at $45 (looks like 33% off)

---

## Red Flags

- Price < total cost × 2 without Francisco's approval
- Missing ANY cost component (especially marketing allocation)
- Competitor data from fewer than 3 sources
- "Guessing" price without knowing exact BuckyDrop costs
- Competitors all below our minimum → FLAG, don't list
