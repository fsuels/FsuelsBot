# 💰 Pricing Procedure (MANDATORY)

**Read this COMPLETELY before ANY price calculation.**

## The Golden Rule

```
╔═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║  MINIMUM PRICE = TOTAL COST + 50% PROFIT                          ║
║                                                                   ║
║  TOTAL COST = Product + Domestic Ship + Intl Ship + Marketing +   ║
║               Returns Allowance                                   ║
╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

**Never deviate without Francisco's explicit approval.**

## Cost Components (Get ALL of These)

### 1. Product Price
- From 1688 or supplier listing

### 2. Domestic Shipping (Factory → BuckyDrop Warehouse)
- **Source:** BuckyDrop provides this when you upload the product URL
- All products have this because they ship from factory to warehouse first

### 3. International Shipping (BuckyDrop → Customer)  
- **Source:** BuckyDrop estimate
- **How to get:** Select country (USA), input product weight
- **⚠️ GET WEIGHT FROM 1688 LISTING** — the product listing shows weight, use that
- **⚠️ SELECT YUNEXPRESS ROUTE** — "YunExpress clothing Registered Air Mail" (14-21 days)
- **⚠️ USE USA SHIPPING FOR ALL MARKETS** — USA is biggest market, use that price globally

### 4. Marketing Allowance
- Estimate ~10-15% of product cost for ads/promotion

### 5. Returns Allowance
- Estimate ~5-10% for returns/refunds

---

## Formula

```
Total Cost = Product + Domestic Ship + Intl Ship + Platform Fee + Value-Added Services
Minimum Price = Total Cost × 1.5  (adds 50% profit)
```

**The 50% profit margin is NON-NEGOTIABLE.**

## 🔍 Competitor Research (REQUIRED)

**Before setting final price, check what competitors charge:**

### Where to Check:
1. **Amazon** — search same product type
2. **Etsy** — mommy and me / matching outfits
3. **Other Shopify stores** — Google "[product] mommy and me"
4. **DressLikeMommy competitors** — PatPat, SHEIN, etc.

### What to Capture:
- Competitor price range (low / high)
- Shipping costs they charge
- Any bundles or upsells

### Pricing Decision Matrix:

| Competitor Price | vs Our Min (2× cost) | Action |
|------------------|----------------------|--------|
| **Higher** | They charge $40, our min is $25 | ✅ Price at $34.99 — room for more margin! |
| **Same** | They charge $25, our min is $25 | ✅ Price at $24.99 — competitive |
| **Lower** | They charge $18, our min is $25 | ⚠️ STOP — either find cheaper supplier or skip product |

### The Sweet Spot:
```
IDEAL PRICE = Competitor average - $1 to $5 (undercut slightly)
BUT NEVER below our 50% margin minimum
```

### Verification Gate (Competitor Check):
> "Competitor check: [Product] sells for $[X]-$[Y] on [Amazon/Etsy]. Our cost is $[Z]. Setting price at $[P] (margin: [M]%)."

If competitors are ALL below our minimum → **flag to Francisco before listing**.

## Real Example (from BuckyDrop)

Product: Red Heart Sweatshirt (150g, shipped to USA)

| Component | CNY | USD |
|-----------|-----|-----|
| Product price | ¥36.9 | $5.19 |
| Domestic Shipping | ¥6 | $0.84 |
| Global Shipping (USA) | ¥46.65 | $6.56 |
| Platform service | ¥5.5 | $0.77 |
| Value-added services | ¥13.1 | $1.84 |
| **TOTAL COST** | **¥108.15** | **$15.21** |

**Minimum Price (50% profit):** $15.21 × 1.5 = **$22.82 → round to $22.99 or $24.99**

## Quick Calculation

| Cost | Minimum Price | Profit Margin |
|------|---------------|---------------|
| $5   | $10           | 50%           |
| $10  | $20           | 50%           |
| $15  | $30           | 50%           |
| $20  | $40           | 50%           |
| $25  | $50           | 50%           |
| $30  | $60           | 50%           |

**Formula:** Just double the cost. That's your floor.

---

## Verification Gate

**Before setting ANY price, state BOTH:**

> "Pricing check: Cost is $[X]. Minimum price (×1.5) is $[Y]."
> "Competitor check: Similar items sell for $[A]-$[B] on [platform]. Setting price to $[Z] ([M]% margin)."

**Red flags:**
- If Z < Y → STOP. You're pricing too low.
- If Z > B (highest competitor) → STOP. You may not sell.
- If Y > A (competitors cheaper than our minimum) → FLAG to Francisco.

---

## Compare-At Pricing (Optional)

For perceived value, you can set a compare-at (strikethrough) price:

- Actual price: 2× cost (minimum)
- Compare-at: 2.5× to 3× cost (creates "sale" perception)

Example:
- Cost: $15
- Price: $30 (2× - minimum)
- Compare-at: $45 (3× - perceived discount)

---

## Red Flags (STOP and recalculate)

🚩 Price is less than cost (losing money on every sale)
🚩 Price is between 1× and 2× cost (losing money after fees)
🚩 You're "guessing" the price without knowing cost
🚩 Someone suggests a price without cost basis

**If any red flag appears:** STOP, get the exact cost, apply 2× formula.

---

## Exception Process

The ONLY way to price below 2× cost:

1. Francisco explicitly says "price this at $X even though margin is low"
2. You document the exception in memory
3. You note it's a deliberate exception, not the rule

**No other exception is valid.**
