## Common Issues & Templates

### Pre-Sale: Size Questions (SALES OPPORTUNITY)
```
Hi [Name]!

Great question about sizing! Here's my recommendation:

For [CHILD'S AGE/MEASUREMENTS], I'd suggest size [X].
For yourself at [HEIGHT/SIZE], [SIZE] would be perfect.

Our most popular combo for families like yours is [RECOMMENDATION].

Want me to help you pick the perfect matching set? 💕
