## Program Structures

### Option 1: Points-Based System

**How It Works**
```
Earn: 1 point per $1 spent
Redeem: 100 points = $5 off

Bonus points:
- First purchase: 50 bonus points
- Birthday: 100 points
- Review with photo: 50 points
- Referral: 200 points
```

**Pros**: Simple, familiar, flexible
**Cons**: Can feel transactional, points devalue over time

### Option 2: Tiered VIP Program

**Tiers**
| Tier | Requirement | Benefits |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Member** | Sign up | 5% back in points, birthday reward |
| **Silver** | 2+ orders or $150+ | 10% back, early access |
| **Gold** | 4+ orders or $300+ | 15% back, free shipping, exclusive |
| **Platinum** | 8+ orders or $500+ | 20% back, VIP support, surprises |

**Pros**: Creates aspiration, tiered engagement
**Cons**: More complex, higher tier customers expect more

### Option 3: Paid Membership

**Structure**
```
Join for $29/year and get:
- 15% off everything, always
- Free shipping on all orders
- Early access to sales (48h)
- Birthday gift
- Exclusive member-only products
```

**Pros**: Immediate revenue, high commitment
**Cons**: Barrier to entry, requires strong value prop

### Recommendation for Mommy-and-Me
**Tiered VIP + Points Hybrid**
- Points for earning/redeeming
- Tiers for status and escalating benefits
- Matches the aspirational, family-focused brand
