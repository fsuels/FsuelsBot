## Content Strategy

- **Quality**: High-res, well-lit
- **Style**: Lifestyle > flat lay

**Image Optimization**

**Pin Description Formula**
```
Hook statement with primary keyword.
2-3 sentences describing the product/benefit with secondary keywords naturally included.
Call-to-action (Shop now, Get the look, etc.)
3-5 relevant hashtags (yes, hashtags work on Pinterest)
```

**Example**
```
