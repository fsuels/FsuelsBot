## Step-by-Step Process

### Phase 1: Finding Influencers

1. **Hashtag Mining**
   - Search: #mommyandme, #twinningwithmommy, #motherdaughter
   - Look at who's posting, not who's tagged
   - Note engagement rates, not just followers

2. **Competitor Analysis**
   - Who's posting about similar brands?
   - Check competitor tagged photos
   - Look at who they follow

3. **Platform-Specific Search**
   
   **Instagram**
   - Use native search with location filters
   - Check Reels creators in your niche
   - Look at who your ideal customers follow
   
   **TikTok**
   - Search trending hashtags
   - Find creators with viral mommy content
   - Check "For You" page patterns
   
   **Pinterest**
   - Look at top pinners in your categories
   - Check Idea Pin creators
   - Review who's sharing product content

4. **Tools for Discovery**
   - **Modash** ($99/mo) - Database search
   - **Heepsy** ($49/mo) - Influencer discovery
   - **Grin** ($Enterprise) - Full platform
   - **Manual search** - Free, time-intensive

### Phase 2: Vetting Influencers

**Vetting Checklist**
```
□ Engagement rate >3% (comments / followers × 100)
□ Comments are genuine (not just "🔥🔥🔥")
□ Follower growth is organic (no sudden spikes)
□ Content quality matches your brand
□ Audience demographics align (check with them)
□ Has done brand partnerships before (easier to work with)
□ No controversial content/history
□ Active posting (at least 3x/week)
□ Aesthetic matches your brand
□ Has children in appropriate age range
```

**Red Flags**
- Follower:following ratio near 1:1 (follow-for-follow)
- Sudden follower jumps (bought followers)
- Generic comments from bots
- Promotes competing products constantly
- Poor content quality
- No face/personality in content
- Inactive or inconsistent posting

### Phase 3: Outreach

**Email Template (Cold)**
```

**Response Rate Expectations**
- Cold email: 5-15% response
- DM: 10-25% response
- Need to contact 50-100 to land 10-15 partnerships

### Phase 4: Partnership Setup

1. **Define Deliverables**
   - Number of posts (1-3)
   - Format (Reel, Stories, static post, TikTok)
   - Timeline (when to post)
   - Caption requirements (tags, hashtags, disclosure)
   - Usage rights (can you use their content?)

2. **Compensation Options**
   
   | Type | Best For | Pros | Cons |
   |------|----------|------|------|
   | Gifted | Nano/Micro | Low cost | No guarantee |
   | Flat Fee | All sizes | Predictable | Upfront cost |
   | Affiliate | Engaged audiences | Performance-based | Lower effort from influencer |
   | Hybrid | Micro/Mid | Balance | Complexity |

3. **Contract Must-Haves**
   - Deliverables and deadlines
   - FTC disclosure requirements (#ad, #sponsored)
   - Usage rights (where you can repost)
   - Exclusivity period (if any)
   - Content approval process
   - Payment terms
   - Cancellation terms

4. **Discount Code Setup**
   - Unique code per influencer (INFLUENCERNAME15)
   - Track code usage in Shopify
   - Typical: 15-20% off for their audience
   - Commission: 10-20% of code sales (if affiliate)

### Phase 5: Execution

1. **Product Selection**
   - Let influencer choose (invested in content)
   - OR curate based on their aesthetic
   - Include size options for perfect fit
   - Add handwritten note

2. **Shipping & Tracking**
   - Send with tracking
   - Confirm receipt
   - Set deadline for content (2-4 weeks after receipt)

3. **Content Review**
   - Request draft/preview before posting (if in contract)
   - Check for brand alignment
   - Verify FTC disclosure present
   - Provide feedback kindly

4. **Post-Posting**
   - Engage immediately (like, comment, share)
   - Share to your Stories
   - Save content for repurposing
   - Track performance

### Phase 6: Measurement & Optimization

**Track Per Influencer**
- Discount code redemptions
- Revenue generated
- UTM link clicks
- Follower gain during campaign
- Content engagement
- Quality of UGC received

**Calculate ROI**
```
Influencer ROI = (Revenue from code + Value of UGC) / Total Cost

Example:
Revenue: $500 from 10 orders using their code
UGC Value: $200 (content you'd pay for otherwise)
Total Cost: $150 (product + shipping)
ROI = ($500 + $200) / $150 = 4.7x
```
