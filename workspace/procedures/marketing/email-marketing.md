## Segmentation Strategy

### Must-Have Segments

| Segment | Definition | Use |
|---------|-----------|-----|

| At-risk | No opens in 60-90 days | Win-back flows |
| VIP | 3+ orders OR $500+ spent | Early access, exclusives |
| First-timers | 1 order only | Second purchase push |
| High-AOV | Orders $100+ | Premium product focus |
| Sale shoppers | Only buys on discount | Promo-only sends |
| Full-price | Buys without discount | Avoid discounting |

### Advanced Segments

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Avoid These

2. **Sending to everyone** - Kills open rates, triggers spam filters
3. **No segmentation** - One-size emails don't convert
4. **Ignoring mobile** - 60%+ opens are mobile
5. **Walls of text** - Emails should be scannable
6. **Weak subject lines** - 80% of success is getting opened
7. **No automation** - Flows should run while you sleep
8. **Over-discounting** - Trains customers to wait for sales
9. **Not cleaning list** - Remove non-openers every 90 days
10. **Single CTA** - Have one clear action per email

## Expert Tips ($10M Store Tactics)

### 🎯 Advanced Strategies

1. **The 80/20 Subject Line Rule**
   - 80% of opens are decided by subject line
   - Test: Question vs Statement, Emoji vs No emoji, Length
   - Keep swipe file of winners

2. **Plain Text Emails Work**
   - For win-back and personal touches
   - Higher deliverability
   - Feels like real email from friend

3. **Preview Text is Second Subject Line**
   - Don't let it default to "View in browser"
   - Use it to complete the subject line hook

4. **Sunset Non-Engaged Subscribers**
   - After 120 days no opens → send final win-back
   - Then remove from list
   - Quality > Quantity for deliverability

5. **The "Founder Email" Hack**
   - Plain text emails "from the founder"
   - Personal story + offer
   - 2-3x higher reply rates

6. **Resend to Non-Openers**
   - 48-72 hours later with new subject line
   - Easy 10-20% more opens

7. **Zero-Party Data Collection**
   - Ask preferences in flows
   - "Are you shopping for mom or child sizes?"
   - "What's your style: casual or dressy?"
   - Use for hyper-personalization

8. **Post-Purchase Upsell Timing**
   - Best time to sell: right after purchase
   - Add order bump in confirmation email
   - "Add X to your order before it ships"

4. Send only to most engaged for 2 weeks
5. Review authentication (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)

### If open rates crater:
1. Check if landed in Promotions/Spam
2. Try plain text email
3. Test radically different subject lines
4. Send at different time
5. Segment to engaged only, rebuild trust
