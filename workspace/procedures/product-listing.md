# 📦 Complete Product Listing Procedure (MANDATORY)

**Read this COMPLETELY before ANY product listing or sourcing task.**

---

## Verification Gate

**Before starting ANY listing work, state:**

> "Product procedure verified. Checked existing inventory: [X active, Y drafts]. Browser tabs checked: [N] open. Ready for [discovery/import/draft] phase."

If you cannot state this, STOP and do the pre-flight checklist.

---

## Phase 0: Know What We Have (ALWAYS FIRST)

Before sourcing ANY new products:

1. **Check Shopify inventory**
   - Active products in the relevant collection
   - Draft products in progress
   - Don't duplicate what we already have!

2. **Check current drafts list**
   - What's already being worked on?
   - What's waiting for Francisco's review?

**State:** "Inventory check: [X] active products, [Y] drafts in queue. Looking for: [product type]."

## Phase 1: Product Discovery on 1688

### 1.1 Vendor Quality Checks (CRITICAL)

**Before selecting ANY product, verify the vendor:**

- [ ] **Store rating** — 4.5+ stars preferred, never below 4.0
- [ ] **Transaction volume** — Active sales (shows recent orders)
- [ ] **Store age** — Established sellers (1+ years preferred)
- [ ] **Response rate** — High response = reliable communication
- [ ] **Product availability** — Check stock indicators, avoid "last item" or low stock
- [ ] **1-piece dropshipping** — Must allow single unit orders (no MOQ)
- [ ] **Fast warehouse delivery** — 24-48hrs to BuckyDrop China warehouse

**Red flags (AVOID these vendors):**
- ❌ No recent sales/reviews
- ❌ Store opened recently with no history
- ❌ Poor ratings or many complaints
- ❌ Listings that look too good to be true
- ❌ Products showing "sold out" or "discontinued"
- ❌ **Old listings** — factories keep discontinued products as "hooks"

### 1.2 Product Selection Criteria

**We sell: Mommy and me / family matching outfits**

Good products have:
- ✅ **Multiple sizes** — Adult AND child sizes in same listing
- ✅ **Matching designs** — Same fabric/pattern for both
- ✅ **Good photos** — Clear, professional images
- ✅ **Hot market appeal** — Seasonal (Valentine, Easter, etc.) or evergreen (solid patterns)
- ✅ **Reasonable base cost** — Allows 50%+ margin at competitive price

**Avoid:**
- ❌ Adult-only products (not "matching")
- ❌ Poor quality photos
- ❌ Products from unreliable vendors
- ❌ Items already in our catalog (check Phase 0!)

### 1.3 Freshness Check (CRITICAL)

- Sort by "newest" or "recent sales" when searching
- **Check listing creation date** — recently created listings only
- Verify product photos look current (not dated styles)
- **Avoid old listings** — factories don't update discontinued products, keep old listings as "hooks" to attract buyers

**State:** "Product discovery: Vendor [name] has [rating], [transaction count] sales. Listing created [date]. 1-piece OK. 24-48hr delivery. Product fits matching criteria."

## Phase 2: BuckyDrop Import

1. Open BuckyDrop (use existing tab if open)
2. Import product using 1688 URL
3. **Extract from 1688 listing:**
   - **Product weight** — use ADULT size weight only
   - **Size chart table** — all measurements (chest, length, sleeve, etc.)
   - **Size names** — note original names for conversion later
4. Configure:
   - Shipping route: **YunExpress** (default)
   - Shipping destination: **USA** (use for ALL countries to save time)
   - Variants: all sizes needed

5. **Get the FULL cost breakdown:**
   - Product cost
   - Domestic shipping (China)
   - International shipping (to USA) — **use weight for accurate estimate**
   - BuckyDrop fees
   - **TOTAL COST = sum of all above**

**State:** "BuckyDrop import complete. Weight: [X]g. Total cost: $[Y] (product $[A] + domestic $[B] + intl $[C] + fees $[D])."

---

## Phase 3: Pricing

### The Formula (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

```
MINIMUM PRICE = TOTAL COST × 2

This ensures AT LEAST 50% profit margin AFTER:
- Ads cost buffer
- Returns cost buffer
- Platform fees

Examples:
- $10 total cost → $20 minimum price
- $15 total cost → $30 minimum price  
- $24 total cost → $48 minimum price
```

### Competitor Check (MUST BE COMPETITIVE)

Before finalizing price:
1. Search Amazon, Etsy, Google Shopping for similar products
2. Note competitor price range
3. **If competitors are cheaper than our 2× cost:**
   - Can we find a cheaper source?
   - Is the margin still acceptable at competitor price?
   - FLAG to Francisco if margin drops below 40%
4. **Price to be competitive** — don't just 2× if market won't bear it
5. If room exists → price between 2× cost and competitor average

**State:** "Pricing: Cost $[X] × 2 = $[Y] minimum. Competitors at $[A]-$[B]. Final price: $[Z] ([M]% margin after ads/returns buffer)."

---

## Phase 4: Shopify Draft Creation

### 4.1 Basic Info
- **Title:** Clear, SEO-friendly (e.g., "Valentine Heart Mommy and Me Matching Pajamas")
- **Description:** Benefits, materials, sizing info
- **Product type:** Set appropriately (T-Shirt, Sweatshirt, Dress, Pajamas, etc.)

### 4.2 Category & Metafields (CRITICAL FOR DISCOVERABILITY)

**Study existing similar products** to understand the tagging patterns!

**Category Selection:**
- Choose correct category (e.g., Sweatshirts in Clothing > Tops)
- This auto-populates some category metafields

**Category Metafields (for site filters):**
- **Color** — Use exact values from existing filter (Red, Pink, White, Black, Blue, Green, etc.) — capitalize consistently!
- **Size** — All sizes in the listing
- **Fabric** — Material type
- **Age group** — Kids, Adults, All Ages
- **Target gender** — Female, Male, Unisex

**Product Metafields (for breadcrumbs/SEO):**
- **Pattern** — Hearts, Floral, Solid, Stripes, etc.
- **Style** — Casual, Formal, etc.
- **Type** — Product type
- **SubCategory / SubCategory2** — Navigation hierarchy
- **Category1** — Top-level category

### 4.3 Tags (MUST INCLUDE)

Tags enable filtering and collection organization. **Study existing products for patterns!**

**Required tags:**
- **Color tags** — `red heart`, `pink`, `white`, etc.
- **Size tags** — If needed for filtering
- **Collection tags** — `valentines day`, `christmas`, `summer`, etc.
- **Relationship tags** — `mother daughter`, `daddy and me`, `matching family`
- **Brand tags** — `Mommy and Me`
- **Product type tags** — `sweatshirt`, `pajamas`, `t-shirt`, etc.

**Example for Valentine product:**
```
valentines day, red heart, mother daughter, Mommy and Me, matching family, heart sweatshirt, family outfit
```

### 4.4 Collections

Add product to appropriate collections:
- **Mommy and Me** — always
- **New Mommy & Me** — if new product
- **Seasonal collection** — Valentine's Day, Christmas, Summer, etc.
- **Category collections** — Swimwear, Pajamas, T-Shirts, etc.

### 4.5 Images
- Upload all product images
- **FACE CHECK:** If Chinese faces visible → need face swap
- Order: Main image first, then angles, then size chart

### 4.6 Face Swapping (if needed)

**When:** Product photos show Chinese models

**Process:**
1. Download product images
2. Go to: https://aifaceswap.io/#face-swap-playground
3. Use faces from: `C:\Users\Fsuels\Downloads\faces`
4. Swap to American-looking faces
5. Save new images
6. Upload to Shopify

**State:** "Face swap: [X] images processed with American faces."

### 4.7 Size Chart (CRITICAL)

**Get measurements FROM the 1688 listing:**

1. **Extract size table from 1688** — find the measurements (chest, length, sleeve, etc.)
2. **Create table with actual numbers** — use the exact measurements provided
3. **Convert size names to our standard:**
   - Kids: 80cm, 90cm, 100cm, 110cm, 120cm, 130cm, 140cm, 150cm
   - Adults: Adult S, Adult M, Adult L, Adult XL, Adult XXL, Adult 3XL
4. **Apply size conversion script** — format for Shopify
5. **Verify dynamic selector works** — customer picks size, sees correct measurements

**Never guess sizes** — always use the actual numbers from the 1688 listing.

**State:** "Size chart: Extracted from 1688, [X] sizes, converted to our naming, script applied."

### 4.8 Variants & Pricing

- Set up all size variants (Adult S/M/L/XL, Child sizes)
- Apply calculated price to all variants
- Verify no variant is priced below minimum

### 4.9 Save as DRAFT

- **NEVER publish active** — Francisco reviews all drafts first
- Save as DRAFT
- Note draft number for tracking

**State:** "Draft #[N] created: [Product name]. Price: $[X]. Tags: [list]. Collections: [list]. Awaiting Francisco's review."

---

## Phase 5: Cleanup & Tracking

1. **Browser tabs:** Close any unneeded, keep ≤ 4
2. **Update tracking:**
   - state.json → Update progress count
   - memory file → Log what was completed
3. **Update draft list** for Phase 0 of next product
