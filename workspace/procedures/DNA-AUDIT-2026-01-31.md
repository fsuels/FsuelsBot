# 🧬 DNA AUDIT — Complete System Review

**Date:** 2026-01-31 21:18 EST
**Standard:** THE MOTTO

```
EVERY response I give
EVERY analysis I make
EVERY recommendation I offer
EVERY claim I accept
EVERY action I take
        ↓
   SOUND LOGIC
 VERIFIED EVIDENCE
   NO FALLACIES
```

## 📋 AUDIT SCOPE

| Category | Files | Purpose |
|----------|-------|---------|
| **Identity** | SOUL.md, IDENTITY.md | Who I am |
| **Operations** | AGENTS.md, HEARTBEAT.md | How I work |
| **Context** | USER.md, MEMORY.md | Who I serve |
| **Procedures** | procedures/*.md | Task-specific rules |
| **Scripts** | scripts/*.ps1, *.py | Automation logic |
| **Skills** | skills/*/SKILL.md | Capability definitions |
| **Workflows** | workflows/*.json | Process flows |

## 🔍 FINDINGS BY FILE

### 1. SOUL.md ✅ STRONG

**Motto:** ✅ Present at top (added today)
**Epistemic Discipline:** ✅ Comprehensive section exists
**Fallacy Detection:** ✅ Full table with 10 fallacies

**GAPS FOUND:**
| Gap | Issue | Fix |
|-----|-------|-----|
| Self-check trigger | No explicit "before responding" check | Add motto verification step |
| Fallacy in MY responses | Only checks EXTERNAL content | Add self-fallacy detection |

**IMPROVEMENT:**
Add to SOUL.md:
```
## Self-Check Protocol (Before EVERY Response)
Before sending ANY response, verify:
- [ ] My reasoning is SOUND (no logic gaps)
- [ ] My claims are VERIFIED (not assumed)
- [ ] I am not committing a fallacy
If ANY box unchecked → revise before sending.
```

---

### 2. AGENTS.md ⚠️ PARTIAL

**Motto Reference:** ✅ "REPEAT THE MOTTO" in standing rules
**Explicit Check:** ❌ Missing verification step

**GAPS FOUND:**
| Gap | Issue | Fix |
|-----|-------|-----|
| No motto in "Every Session" | Session start doesn't include motto check | Add step 0 |
| Task creation | No fallacy check for new tasks | Add validation |
| Standing rules | Motto rule exists but no enforcement | Add checkpoint |

**IMPROVEMENT:**
Add to "Every Session" section:
```
0. **VERIFY MOTTO COMPLIANCE** — Before any action:
   - SOUND LOGIC: Is my reasoning valid?
   - VERIFIED EVIDENCE: Am I assuming or verifying?
   - NO FALLACIES: Am I falling into a logic trap?
```

---

### 3. HEARTBEAT.md ⚠️ PARTIAL

**Motto:** ❌ Not present
**Checks:** Many automated checks, but no epistemic verification

**GAPS FOUND:**
| Gap | Issue | Fix |
|-----|-------|-----|
| No motto | Heartbeat doesn't include epistemic check | Add section |
| Obligation scan | Checks what to DO, not HOW to think | Add logic check |
| Idle check | Checks permission phrases, not fallacies | Expand |

**IMPROVEMENT:**
Add new section:
```
## Epistemic Health Check (EVERY heartbeat)
Before any action in this heartbeat:
- [ ] Am I making assumptions without evidence?
- [ ] Am I falling for a fallacy (bandwagon, authority, cause)?
- [ ] Would my actions pass the motto test?

If uncertain → pause, verify, then proceed.
```

---

### 4. USER.md ✅ OK

This file is factual data about Francisco. No logic/fallacy issues possible.

**Minor improvement:** Add verification dates for facts that could change.

---

### 5. Scripts — AUDIT NEEDED

**40+ PowerShell scripts, 30+ Python scripts**

**Current state:** Scripts execute logic but don't self-validate.

**GAPS FOUND:**
| Gap | Issue | Fix |
|-----|-------|-----|
| No input validation | Scripts trust their inputs | Add validation |
| No logging of reasoning | Scripts log WHAT, not WHY | Add reason logs |
| Error handling | Some scripts fail silently | Add explicit failures |

**KEY SCRIPTS TO AUDIT:**
1. `preflight-check.ps1` — Should verify motto compliance
2. `cron-to-task.py` — Should validate task logic
3. `learnings.py` — Should detect if learning is sound
4. `epistemic-review.ps1` — ✅ NEW, explicitly checks motto

**IMPROVEMENT:**
Add to critical scripts:
```powershell
# Epistemic validation
function Test-EpistemicCompliance {
    param([string]$Action, [string]$Reasoning, [string]$Evidence)
    if (-not $Reasoning) { throw "Action '$Action' has no reasoning" }
    if (-not $Evidence) { Write-Warning "Action '$Action' has no evidence" }
}
```

### 6. Skills — NEED MOTTO HEADERS

**10 skills in workspace/skills/**

**Current state:** Skills define capabilities but don't enforce motto.

**GAPS FOUND:**
| Skill | Has Motto? | Has Fallacy Check? |
|-------|------------|-------------------|
| council | ✅ Implicit (cross-exam) | ✅ Adversarial |
| research | ❌ | ❌ |
| humanizer | ❌ | ❌ |
| tweet-writer | ❌ | ❌ |
| prompt-engineering-expert | ❌ | ❌ |
| self-improving-agent | ❌ | ❌ |

**IMPROVEMENT:**
Add standard header to ALL skill SKILL.md files:
```markdown
## 🧭 EPISTEMIC DISCIPLINE
Before using this skill, verify:
- SOUND LOGIC: Is the approach valid?
- VERIFIED EVIDENCE: Are inputs verified?
- NO FALLACIES: Am I avoiding logic traps?
```

---

### 7. Workflows — NO MOTTO INTEGRATION

**11 workflow JSON files**

**Current state:** Workflows define steps but no validation.

**EXAMPLE:** `create-listing.json`
```json
{"step": 1, "label": "Find product on 1688", "done": false}
```

**MISSING:** No logic verification at any step.

**IMPROVEMENT:**
Add to workflow schema:
```json
{
  "step": 1,
  "label": "Find product on 1688",
  "verification": {
    "logic_check": "Is this the right product type?",
    "evidence_needed": "1688 URL, vendor rating",
    "fallacy_risk": "Bandwagon (popular ≠ good)"
  }
}
```

| Priority | File/Area | Fix | Impact |
|----------|-----------|-----|--------|
| **P0** | AGENTS.md | Add motto to "Every Session" | Core behavior |
| **P0** | HEARTBEAT.md | Add epistemic health check | Periodic enforcement |
| **P0** | SOUL.md | Add self-check protocol | Pre-response filter |

## 🔄 IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

### Phase 1: Core Files (NOW)
1. ✅ SOUL.md — motto added (done today)
2. 🔲 AGENTS.md — add motto to "Every Session"
3. 🔲 HEARTBEAT.md — add epistemic health check

### Phase 2: Scripts (This Week)
1. 🔲 Add validation to preflight-check.ps1
2. 🔲 Add validation to cron-to-task.py
3. 🔲 Create reusable validation module

### Phase 3: Skills (This Week)
1. 🔲 Add motto header to all 10 skills
2. 🔲 Audit each skill for fallacy risks

### Phase 4: Workflows (Next Week)
1. 🔲 Update workflow schema
2. 🔲 Add verification to each workflow

---

## 📊 METRICS TO TRACK

After implementation:
- **Violations found per review** — should decrease
- **Repeat errors** — should approach zero
- **Self-corrections** — should increase (catching before external)

---

## ✅ CONCLUSION

**The motto is embedded in procedures, but NOT fully in:**
1. Session startup (AGENTS.md)
2. Heartbeat checks (HEARTBEAT.md)
3. Self-response validation (SOUL.md)
4. Skills and workflows

**Action:** Implement P0 fixes now, P1 this week, P2 next week.
