## Step-by-Step Procedure

### Step 1: Audit Current Meta Tags
- [ ] Go to Shopify Admin > Online Store > Preferences
- [ ] Note homepage title and description
- [ ] Spot-check 5 product pages and 5 collection pages
- [ ] Document current state and issues

### Step 2: Optimize Homepage
- [ ] Navigate to Online Store > Preferences
- [ ] **Title tag format:** `[Primary Keyword] | [Brand Name]`
  - Example: `Mommy and Me Matching Outfits | Dress Like Mommy`
- [ ] **Meta description format:** Include primary keyword, value prop, CTA
  - Example: `Shop adorable mommy and me matching outfits for every occasion. Free shipping on orders $50+. Find the perfect matching look for you and your mini!`
- [ ] Verify length: Title 50-60 chars, Description 150-160 chars

### Step 3: Optimize Collection Pages
For each collection page:
- [ ] Go to Products > Collections > [Collection] > Edit
- [ ] Scroll to "Search engine listing preview" > Edit
- [ ] **Title format:** `[Primary Keyword] - [Modifier] | [Brand]`
  - Example: `Valentine's Day Mommy and Me Outfits - Matching Sets | Dress Like Mommy`
- [ ] **Description format:** Include keyword, unique selling point, CTA
  - Example: `Celebrate Valentine's Day in style with matching mommy and me outfits. Hearts, reds, and pinks perfect for photos. Shop our curated Valentine's collection now!`

### Step 4: Optimize Product Pages
For each product:
- [ ] Go to Products > [Product] > Edit
- [ ] Scroll to "Search engine listing preview" > Edit
- [ ] **Title format:** `[Product Name] - [Key Feature] | [Brand]`
  - Example: `Heart Print Mommy and Me Sweatshirts - Matching Set | Dress Like Mommy`
- [ ] **Description format:** Product benefit, keyword, CTA
  - Example: `Adorable heart print matching sweatshirts for mommy and me. Soft, comfortable fabric perfect for Valentine's Day photos or everyday twinning. Available in all sizes.`

### Step 5: Optimize URL Handles
- [ ] Check each page's URL handle (Shopify calls it "URL and handle")
- [ ] **Format:** Use hyphens, include primary keyword
  - Good: `/products/heart-mommy-and-me-sweatshirt`
  - Bad: `/products/product-12345`
- [ ] **Warning:** Changing URLs on existing pages requires 301 redirects

### Step 6: Verify and Document
- [ ] Use browser to view page source and verify meta tags are correct
- [ ] Document optimized pages in tracking spreadsheet
- [ ] Set reminder for monthly audit
