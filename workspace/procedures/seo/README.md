## How This Works

When Francisco says **"fix all SEO"** or similar:
1. Run a FULL AUDIT first (Batch 0)
2. Generate a prioritized fix list
3. Work through fixes in BATCHES (not all at once)
4. Verify each fix before moving to next
5. Report progress after each batch

**NEVER** try to fix everything in one pass. Systematic batches = nothing missed.

## Batch Structure

| Batch | Name | Scope | Typical Time |
|-------|------|-------|--------------|
| 0 | Audit | Scan everything, create fix list | 5-10 min |
| 1 | Critical | Core Web Vitals, crawl errors | 15-30 min |
| 2 | Technical | Schema, sitemap, robots, redirects | 20-30 min |
| 3 | On-Page | Titles, descriptions, H1s, URLs | 30-60 min |
| 4 | Content | Product descriptions, alt text | 45-90 min |
| 5 | Collections | Collection pages SEO | 20-30 min |
| 6 | Advanced | Internal links, content gaps, speed | 30-60 min |
