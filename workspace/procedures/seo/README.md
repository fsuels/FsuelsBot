## 🎯 NORTH STAR: INCREASE SALES & MAKE MONEY

**All SEO work must prioritize revenue-generating pages and quick wins that drive traffic to products.**

SEO is not about rankings for vanity. It's about:
1. **Getting BUYERS to product pages** (not just visitors)
2. **Ranking for PURCHASE-INTENT keywords** (not informational fluff)
3. **Quick wins that generate traffic THIS MONTH** (not 6 months from now)
