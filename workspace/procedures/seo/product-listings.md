  - Good: `heart-print-mommy-me-matching-sweatshirt`
  - Bad: `product-12345` or `red-top`
- [ ] Use hyphens between words
- [ ] Keep concise but descriptive

### Step 4: Add Product Tags
Tags help with internal search and organization:
- [ ] Add category tag: `matching-sets`, `sweatshirts`, `tops`
- [ ] Add occasion tag: `valentines`, `everyday`, `holiday`
- [ ] Add style tag: `hearts`, `pink`, `red`
- [ ] Add size tag: `mommy-sizes`, `kids-sizes`

### Step 5: Set Product Category (for Google Shopping)
- [ ] In Product > Organization > Product category
- [ ] Select most specific category:
  - Apparel & Accessories > Clothing > Shirts & Tops
  - Or: Apparel & Accessories > Clothing > Sleepwear & Loungewear
- [ ] This feeds into Google Merchant Center

### Step 6: Add to Appropriate Collections
- [ ] Add to main collection: All Products
- [ ] Add to category collection: Sweatshirts, Tops
- [ ] Add to occasion collection: Valentine's Day
- [ ] Add to featured collection if applicable: New Arrivals, Best Sellers

### Step 7: Complete Image SEO (See images.md)
- [ ] All images have descriptive filenames
- [ ] All images have alt text with keywords
- [ ] First image is the best (it shows in search results)

### Step 8: Add Product-Level Schema (Automatic in Shopify)
Shopify automatically adds Product schema, but verify:
- [ ] Price is visible
