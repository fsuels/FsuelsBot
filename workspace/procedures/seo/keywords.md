## Step-by-Step Procedure

### Step 1: Identify Seed Keywords
- [ ] List core product categories: mommy and me dresses, matching pajamas, etc.
- [ ] List product types: dresses, tops, swimsuits, pajamas, accessories
- [ ] List occasions: wedding, birthday, holiday, everyday
- [ ] Combine: "mommy and me [product] for [occasion]"

### Step 2: Expand with Free Tools
- [ ] Enter each seed keyword into Google Keyword Planner
- [ ] Note search volume (high/medium/low) and competition
- [ ] Check Google's "People also ask" and "Related searches"
- [ ] Use AnswerThePublic for question-based keywords

### Step 3: Analyze Search Intent
For each keyword, classify intent:
- [ ] **Informational:** "what to wear for mommy and me photos" → Blog content
- [ ] **Commercial:** "best mommy and me outfits" → Collection page
- [ ] **Transactional:** "buy mommy and me matching dresses" → Product page
- [ ] **Navigational:** "dress like mommy shop" → Homepage

### Step 4: Map Keywords to Pages

| Keyword | Intent | Page Type | Target Page |
|---------|--------|-----------|-------------|
| mommy and me outfits | Commercial | Collection | /collections/all |
| matching mother daughter dresses | Transactional | Collection | /collections/dresses |
| mommy and me Valentine outfits | Transactional | Collection | /collections/valentines |
| [product name] | Transactional | Product | /products/[handle] |

### Step 5: Document Keyword Map
- [ ] Create spreadsheet with: Keyword, Volume, Intent, Target Page, Current Rank
- [ ] Assign ONE primary keyword per page (avoid cannibalization)
- [ ] Assign 2-3 secondary keywords per page
- [ ] Save to `knowledge/seo/keyword-map.md`

### Step 6: Identify Quick Wins
- [ ] Check Google Search Console for queries with impressions but low clicks
- [ ] These are "striking distance" keywords (position 11-20)
- [ ] Prioritize optimizing pages for these terms
