# Local SEO Procedure

> **Verification Gate:** Before proceeding, state: "I have read the local SEO procedure. Local SEO is primarily for businesses with physical locations. For pure e-commerce without a storefront, local SEO is low priority."

## Purpose
Optimize for local search visibility if you have a physical location or serve a specific geographic area.

## Applicability

**High Priority If:**
- You have a physical retail store
- You offer local pickup
- You serve a specific geographic area
- You want to appear in "near me" searches

**Low Priority If:**
- Pure online-only store (like Dress Like Mommy currently)
- Ship nationwide with no local focus
- No physical location

---

## For Pure E-commerce Stores (Like Dress Like Mommy)

### What to Skip
- Google Business Profile (requires physical address)
- Local keyword optimization ("mommy and me outfits Naples FL")
- Local citations and directories

### What to Focus On Instead
- National SEO (covered in other procedures)
- Regional targeting in Google Merchant Center (if shipping varies)
- State-specific landing pages (only if you have reason to target specific states)

## For E-commerce with Physical Location

If you add a physical store or pickup location in the future:

### Step 1: Create Google Business Profile
- [ ] Go to business.google.com
- [ ] Create or claim your business
- [ ] Verify via postcard, phone, or email
- [ ] Fill out ALL information completely

### Step 2: Optimize Google Business Profile
- [ ] Business name (exact legal name)
- [ ] Address (accurate, matches everywhere online)
- [ ] Phone number (local number if possible)
- [ ] Business hours
- [ ] Website URL
- [ ] Business category (Clothing Store, Children's Clothing)
- [ ] Attributes (women-owned, minority-owned, etc.)
- [ ] Products (add your products)
- [ ] Photos (interior, exterior, products)

### Step 3: NAP Consistency
NAP = Name, Address, Phone
- [ ] Ensure NAP is identical everywhere:
  - Website footer
  - Google Business Profile
  - Facebook page
  - Yelp (if applicable)

- [ ] Mention local area in content naturally

### Step 5: Local Citations
Submit to local directories:
- [ ] Yelp
- [ ] Yellow Pages
- [ ] Chamber of Commerce
- [ ] Local business directories
- [ ] Industry-specific directories

### Step 6: Reviews
- [ ] Ask satisfied customers for Google reviews
- [ ] Respond to all reviews (positive and negative)
- [ ] Don't incentivize reviews (against Google policy)

### Step 7: Local Content
- [ ] Create content about local events
- [ ] Partner with local businesses
- [ ] Participate in local community events
- [ ] Create "best of [city]" guides related to your niche
