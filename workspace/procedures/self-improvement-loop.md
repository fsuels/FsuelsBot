# Self-Improvement Loop with Council Validation

## The Loop (MANDATORY for all self-improvement work)

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│   IMPLEMENT → COUNCIL VALIDATE      │
│       ↑              ↓              │
│       │         A+? ─┬─→ YES → DONE │
│       │              │              │
│       └── FIX ←──────┘              │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## VERIFICATION GATE (Epistemic Check)

Before marking ANY improvement complete:
- [ ] Improvement has been IMPLEMENTED (not just planned)
- [ ] Council has ACTUALLY been run (not claimed)
- [ ] Questions were SENT to external AIs (evidence exists)
- [ ] Grade is DOCUMENTED in council-sessions/

**Fallacy to avoid:** Proof by assertion ("I improved it" without evidence)

---

## Rules

1. **No exit until Council confirms A+** on all components
2. Council = external AIs (Grok, ChatGPT) — not just self-assessment
3. Ask for *brutally honest* feedback, not validation
4. Fix gaps before claiming completion
5. Document final grades in council-sessions/

## How to Run

1. Implement the improvement
2. Ask Council: "Rate this implementation honestly. What's missing for A+?"
3. If not A+ → fix the gaps → ask again
4. Only mark done when Council confirms A+ on all aspects

## Example Session

See: `council-sessions/2026-01-29-final-a-plus-validation.md`

Grades received: B+ to A on different components. Honest assessment, not rubber-stamp.
