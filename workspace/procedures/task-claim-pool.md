# Task Claim Pool System

**Purpose:** Enable multiple specialized agents to claim and execute tasks in parallel based on their capabilities.

---

## Agent Specialties

Each agent is tagged with specialties that determine which tasks they can claim:

| Agent Type  | Specialty                                         | Example Tasks                                       |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `research`  | Web research, fact-checking, competitive analysis | X analysis, market research, docs audit             |
| `content`   | Writing, drafts, descriptions, copy               | Product listings, blog posts, social media          |
| `audit`     | Verification, quality checks, compliance          | SEO audits, evidence verification, procedure review |
| `analytics` | Data analysis, metrics, reporting                 | Sales analysis, conversion tracking, forecasting    |
| `code`      | Development, scripts, automation                  | PowerShell scripts, Python tools, web scraping      |
| `general`   | Any task (fallback)                               | Simple tasks, coordination                          |

## Task Priority Scoring

Priority score is calculated dynamically: `priority_score = urgency + impact + dependency_boost`

### Urgency (0-40 points)

| Condition         | Points |
| ----------------- | ------ |
| Past due date     | 40     |
| Due within 24h    | 30     |
| Due within 3 days | 20     |
| Due within 7 days | 10     |
| No deadline       | 0      |

### Impact (0-40 points)

| Level      | Points | Criteria                                    |
| ---------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| `critical` | 40     | Revenue-blocking, customer-facing emergency |
| `high`     | 30     | Significant revenue/growth impact           |
| `medium`   | 20     | Noticeable improvement                      |
| `low`      | 10     | Nice-to-have, minor improvement             |
| `none`     | 0      | No measurable business impact               |

### Dependency Boost (0-20 points)

| Condition                   | Points |
| --------------------------- | ------ |
| Task blocks 3+ other tasks  | 20     |
| Task blocks 1-2 other tasks | 10     |
| No dependents               | 0      |

### Final Priority

- **P0 (Critical):** Score 80-100
- **P1 (High):** Score 60-79
- **P2 (Medium):** Score 40-59
- **P3 (Low):** Score 20-39
- **P4 (Backlog):** Score 0-19

## Claiming Protocol

### 1. Agent Requests Work

```
Agent: "Claiming tasks for specialty: research"
```

### 2. System Returns Eligible Tasks

- Filter by `required_agent` matching agent's specialty
- Sort by `priority_score` descending
- Exclude tasks already claimed by other agents
- Return top N available tasks

### 3. Agent Claims Task

- Sets `claimed_by: { agent_id, claimed_at, specialty }`
- Sets `status: in_progress`
- Logs to `memory/parallel-execution.jsonl`

### 4. Parallel Execution Rules

- **Max concurrent per agent:** 1 (focus on completion)
- **Max concurrent total:** 5 (resource limit)
- **Claim timeout:** 30 minutes idle = auto-release
- **Handoff:** Agent can release task back to pool with notes

## Schema Extensions for tasks.json

### Task-Level Fields

```json
{
  "T123": {
    "title": "...",
    "required_agent": "research",      // Which specialty can handle this
    "priority": {
      "urgency": 20,                   // 0-40 based on deadline
      "impact": "high",                // critical/high/medium/low/none
      "impact_score": 30,              // 0-40 calculated
      "dependency_boost": 10,          // 0-20 based on blocking count
      "total_score": 60,               // Sum: P1 priority
      "priority_level": "P1"           // P0-P4 label
    },
    "claimed_by": {
      "agent_id": "subagent:abc123",   // Who has it
      "agent_name": "Research Agent",  // Human-readable
      "specialty": "research",         // What specialty claimed it
      "claimed_at": "2026-02-01T...",  // When claimed
      "last_heartbeat": "2026-02-01T..." // Last activity
    },
    "blocks": ["T124", "T125"],        // Tasks waiting on this one
    "blocked_by": ["T122"],            // Tasks this depends on
    ...existing fields...
  }
}
```

### Top-Level Fields

```json
{
  "version": 235,
  "parallel_execution": {
    "enabled": true,
    "max_concurrent": 5,
    "active_agents": [
      {
        "agent_id": "subagent:abc123",
        "agent_name": "Research Agent",
        "specialty": "research",
        "current_task": "T123",
        "started_at": "2026-02-01T...",
        "last_heartbeat": "2026-02-01T..."

## Implementation Checklist

- [x] Define agent specialties
- [x] Define priority scoring algorithm
- [x] Define schema extensions
- [ ] Update tasks.json with new fields
- [ ] Create priority calculation script
- [ ] Create claim/release functions
- [ ] Update Mission Control UI
- [ ] Create parallel execution log

---

## TRIGGER CONDITIONS

The task claim pool activates when:

1. Multiple sub-agents are spawned (e.g., night shift parallel execution)
2. A task's `required_agent` field matches a specific specialty
3. The orchestrator decides to parallelize work (complexity warrants it)

**Current status:** DESIGN PHASE. Multi-agent parallel execution is not yet operational. This procedure defines the target architecture for when it is activated.

---

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

- [ ] No two agents claim the same task simultaneously (locking works)
- [ ] Tasks are completed faster with parallel agents than sequential
- [ ] Claim timeouts correctly release abandoned tasks
- [ ] Priority scoring produces intuitive ordering (P0 always first)
- [ ] Handoff notes are sufficient for another agent to continue

## ERROR HANDLING

| Error                               | Action                                                                                           |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Two agents claim same task          | Last-write-wins with version check. Losing agent picks next task.                                |
| Agent crashes mid-task              | Claim timeout (30 min) auto-releases. Task returns to pool with agent's partial notes preserved. |
| All high-priority tasks are claimed | Agent works on next available or enters standby with heartbeat.                                  |
| Priority score ties                 | Break ties by: (1) oldest task first, (2) fewest dependencies, (3) smallest scope.               |
| Agent specialty mismatch            | `general` agents can claim any unclaimed task. Specialized agents get priority for their domain. |
| tasks.json version conflict         | Retry with fresh read. If 3 consecutive conflicts, escalate to orchestrator.                     |

## IMPLEMENTATION STATUS

- [x] Agent specialties defined
- [x] Priority scoring algorithm defined
- [x] Schema extensions defined
- [ ] tasks.json updated with new fields
- [ ] Claim/release functions implemented
- [ ] Priority calculation script created
- [ ] Mission Control UI updated
- [ ] Parallel execution log created
- [ ] Integration tested with 2+ agents

**Note:** Until implementation is complete, this procedure serves as a design specification. Do not attempt multi-agent claiming without the supporting code.
