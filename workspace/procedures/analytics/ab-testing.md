# A/B Testing Procedure

## Revenue Impact
Small improvements compound. 10% better conversion = 10% more revenue forever.

---

## What to Test (Priority Order)

### High Impact (Test First)
1. **Product page CTA** - Button color, text, size
2. **Pricing/offers** - Discount % vs $ off vs free shipping
3. **Product images** - Lifestyle vs studio, image order
4. **Checkout flow** - Express checkout placement
5. **Homepage hero** - Different value props

### Medium Impact
6. **Email subject lines** - Always A/B test
7. **Ad creative** - Images, copy, format
8. **Collection page layout** - Grid vs list
9. **Pop-up offers** - 10% vs 15% vs free shipping
10. **Trust badges** - Different placements

### Lower Impact (Test Later)
11. **Font changes**
12. **Color schemes**
13. **Footer layout**
14. **Navigation order**

## How to Run Tests

### Step 1: Hypothesis
"Changing [X] to [Y] will increase [METRIC] by [%] because [REASON]"

Example: "Changing the Add to Cart button from gray to green will increase add-to-cart rate by 10% because green signals 'go' action"

### Step 2: Calculate Sample Size
- Need ~1,000 visitors per variation for significance
- Run test for 1-2 weeks minimum
- Don't end early (even if one looks better)

### Step 3: Run Single Variable Test
- Change ONE thing at a time
- 50/50 split between A and B
- Don't peek and change mid-test

### Step 4: Measure & Decide
- Primary metric improved?
- Statistically significant? (95% confidence)
- Winner becomes new default

## Test Without Tools

### Email A/B (Built into most ESPs)
- Subject line A vs B
- 50% of list each
- Send winner to full list

### Ad Creative (Built into ad platforms)
- Multiple creatives per ad set
- Platform optimizes automatically
- Check after 3-7 days

### Simple Site Tests
- Week 1: Version A
- Week 2: Version B
- Compare same-period metrics
- Not perfect, but better than guessing
