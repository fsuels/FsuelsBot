# 🌐 Browser Procedure (MANDATORY)

**Read this COMPLETELY before ANY browser action.**

---

## Pre-Flight Checklist

Before touching the browser, complete these:

1. [ ] Run `browser tabs` command
2. [ ] Count current tabs: ___
3. [ ] Identify target domain (shopify.com? 1688.com? buckydrop.com?)
4. [ ] Check: Is that domain already open? Y/N

---

## Verification Gate

**You MUST state this in your response before any browser action:**

> "Browser check: [N] tabs open. [domain] [is/is not] already open. Action: [navigate existing tab / open new tab / close tab]."

If you cannot state this, you haven't done the check. STOP and do it.

## The Rules (MEMORIZE)

### Rule 1: ONE TAB PER DOMAIN
- 1 Shopify tab maximum
- 1 BuckyDrop tab maximum  
- 1 1688 tab maximum
- **NEVER** open a second tab for the same site

### Rule 2: NAVIGATE, DON'T DUPLICATE
- Need a different Shopify page? Navigate within the existing Shopify tab
- Need a different 1688 product? Navigate within the existing 1688 tab
- **NEVER** open a new tab when you can navigate

### Rule 3: CLOSE WHEN DONE
- Task complete? Close the tab
- Tab no longer needed? Close it
- **Maximum 3-4 tabs total at any time**

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ Opening Shopify admin when a Shopify tab is already open
❌ Opening new 1688 tab for each product
❌ Leaving 6+ tabs open after a task
❌ Not checking `browser tabs` first

✅ Always check tabs first
✅ Navigate within existing tabs
✅ Close tabs immediately when done
✅ Keep total tabs ≤ 4

## Quick Reference

```
BEFORE: browser tabs → check for domain → decide action
DURING: navigate existing OR open ONE new  
AFTER:  close unneeded tabs → verify ≤ 4 remain
```
