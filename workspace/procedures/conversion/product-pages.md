## Step-by-Step Optimization

### 1. Product Photography

**Required Images (Minimum)**
1. Main product shot (white/clean background)
2. Model shot (showing product worn)
3. Detail shots (fabric, print, quality)
4. Scale shot (shows size context)
5. Lifestyle shot (real-world use)
6. Size comparison (mom + child together for matching)

**For Mommy-and-Me Specifically**
- ALWAYS show both matching items together
- Show mom and child wearing together
- Include individual shots of each size
- Show different size combinations

**Image Requirements**
- Minimum 1000x1000 pixels
- Consistent lighting and style
- Multiple angles
- Zoom-capable quality
- Video if possible (10-30 sec lifestyle)

### 2. Product Title

**Formula**
`[Product Type] + [Key Feature/Style] + [Occasion/Use] + (Color if important)`

**Examples**
✅ "Mommy and Me Matching Floral Maxi Dress - Perfect for Family Photos"
✅ "Mother Daughter Heart Print Sweatshirt Set"
❌ "Dress" (too vague)
❌ "Beautiful Amazing Stunning Gorgeous Dress Style 12847" (keyword stuffing)

**Rules**
- Primary keyword near front
- Under 65 characters for SEO
- Readable and descriptive
- Include "mommy and me" or "matching" for this niche

**Structure**
```
[HOOK - Emotional benefit, 1-2 sentences]

[KEY FEATURES - Bullet points, 4-6 items]
• Feature 1 + benefit
• Feature 2 + benefit
• Feature 3 + benefit
• Feature 4 + benefit

[STORY/USE CASE - When to wear, lifestyle]

[PRODUCT DETAILS]

```
