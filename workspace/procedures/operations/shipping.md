## Processing Time

| Type | Target |
|------|--------|
| Dropship (BuckyDrop) | 1-3 days processing |
| In-house inventory | Same/next day |

**Communicate honestly**: "Ships in 1-3 business days" is fine. Surprising delays = angry customers.

---

## International Shipping

**Considerations**:
- Customs/duties (make customer responsible or included?)
- Longer delivery times
- Higher costs
- Returns complications

**Start with**: US only. Expand when ready.

## Holiday Cutoffs

Publish and communicate shipping deadlines:

| Holiday | Standard Cutoff | Express Cutoff |
|---------|-----------------|----------------|
| Valentine's | Feb 4 | Feb 10 |
| Mother's Day | Apr 28 | May 4 |
| Christmas | Dec 12 | Dec 18 |

**Promote heavily** - countdown banners, emails, urgency.

---

## Handling Delays

When shipping is delayed:

1. **Email immediately** when you know
2. **Explain honestly** - supply chain, weather, etc.
3. **Offer compensation** - 10% off next order
4. **Give new estimate**
5. **Follow up** when resolved

Proactive > Reactive. Always.
