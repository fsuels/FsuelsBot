# Inventory Management Procedure

## Revenue Impact
- Stockouts = lost sales (can't sell what you don't have)
- Overstock = cash trapped in unsold inventory
- Right inventory = maximum revenue, minimum waste

---

## Inventory Rules

### Reorder Point Formula
```
Reorder Point = (Daily Sales × Lead Time) + Safety Stock

Example:
- Selling 5 units/day
- Lead time: 14 days
- Safety stock: 20 units

Reorder when: (5 × 14) + 20 = 90 units
```

### Safety Stock by Velocity
| Product Type | Safety Stock |
|--------------|--------------|
| Top 20% sellers | 3-4 weeks supply |
| Middle 60% | 2 weeks supply |
| Bottom 20% | 1 week or discontinue |

## Daily Tasks

1. **Check low stock alerts** (Shopify notifications)
2. **Review stockouts** - Any products at 0? Prioritize reorder
3. **Check pending orders** - Anything delayed?

---

## Weekly Tasks

1. **Inventory velocity report**
   - Which products selling fastest?
   - Which are sitting?

2. **Reorder check**
   - Any products below reorder point?
   - Place orders with suppliers

3. **Pre-orders/backorders**
   - Update customers on delayed items
   - Consider pre-order for hot items

---

## Monthly Tasks

1. **Dead stock review**
   - No sales in 60+ days = problem
   - Options: Discount, bundle, donate, discontinue

2. **Seasonal planning**
   - What's coming in 60-90 days?
   - Order seasonal inventory early

3. **Supplier performance**
   - On-time delivery rate?
   - Quality issues?

## Dropshipping-Specific (BuckyDrop)

Since we don't hold inventory:

**Monitor**
- Supplier stock levels
- Shipping times (are they increasing?)
- Product availability

**Actions**
- Mark out-of-stock when supplier is out
- Have backup suppliers for bestsellers
- Pause ads for unavailable products

---

## Tools

- **Stocky** (Shopify) - Inventory forecasting
- **Inventory Planner** - Demand planning
- **Spreadsheet** - Simple tracking works too

---

## Quick Wins

1. **Today**: Check for any products at 0 stock
2. **This Week**: Set low stock alerts at reorder points
3. **This Month**: Identify dead stock, plan clearance

---

## Cardinal Rule

**Never run out of your top 10 sellers.** Those products drive most of your revenue. Keep them stocked at all costs.
