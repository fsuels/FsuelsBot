## Reducing Returns

### Prevention (Most Important)

| Return Reason | Prevention |
|---------------|------------|
| Wrong size | Better size guide, photos with measurements |
| Different than expected | More photos, accurate descriptions |
| Quality issues | Better suppliers, QC checks |
| Arrived damaged | Better packaging |
| Changed mind | Hard to prevent - factor into margins |

### Size Guide Investment
**Worth it**: Good size guides can reduce returns 20-30%

Include:
- Measurements for each size
- "Fits true to size" or "runs small"
- Photos on different body types
- "If between sizes, order X"

## Exchange vs Refund

**Push exchanges over refunds**:
- You keep the sale
- Customer gets right product
- Everyone wins

```
Before you return...

✓ We'll ship your new size immediately
